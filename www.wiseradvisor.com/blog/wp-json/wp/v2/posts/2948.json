Diversification refers to keeping a basket of investments like stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, currencies, derivatives, and more. This reduces risk and offers you better exposure to the market.

Exchange-traded funds are self-explanatory. These are bought and sold on the market just like stocks, which is why they are called exchange-traded. Moreover, these are termed a fund because they replicate a mutual fund by pooling in money and investing it further in multiple asset classes. ETFs are also known for their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/article\/portfolio-diversification-228\/\">diversification benefits<\/a>, much like mutual funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you invest in an ETF, you can buy stocks and bonds of several companies at once. Each ETF has an objective and follows an underlying benchmark, sector, commodity, or asset. Similar to stocks, ETF prices also fluctuate throughout the day. This is where they differ from mutual funds, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/article\/what-everyone-should-know-about-mutual-funds-241\/\">mutual funds<\/a> follow the Net Asset Value (NAV) that is determined once during the day. In addition to this, ETFs are also more liquid than mutual funds as they can be bought and sold instantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ETFs invest in different\ninvestments like stocks, commodities, bonds, etc. Moreover, ETFs also expose\nyou to various industries as they concentrate on a variety and are never\nlimited to one or a few. So, if you invest in the S&amp;P 500 ETF, you will\nhave exposure to all the 500 companies of the index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several&nbsp;ETFs to invest in the United States. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF was the first-ever ETF and is actively traded on the stock exchange till today. As of 2020, there were 2,204 ETFs in America.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_invest_in_ETFs\"><\/span><strong>How to invest in\nETFs?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the steps to invest in\nan ETF:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Get_a_brokerage_account\"><\/span>1. <strong>Get a brokerage account<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ETFs can only be traded through\na brokerage account. So, you would have to open one. You can compare different\naccounts, their features, and fees and select the one that offers the most\nbenefits. The focus here can be to pick a cost-effective account to avoid high\ntransaction charges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Find_the_right_ETFs\"><\/span>2. <strong>Find the right ETFs<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have opened your brokerage account, you can start searching for and comparing the different ETFs on the stock exchange. Your brokerage account may contain different types of ETFs based on industry, risk, and more. You can shortlist a few and then invest in them. Bond ETFs may be the&nbsp;safest ETFs to invest in&nbsp;as bonds inherently carry low risk. On the other hand, equity ETFs can be high risk. However, the returns may also be inversely proportionate for both, making equity one of the&nbsp;best ETFs to invest in the long term<strong>.&nbsp;<br> <br> <\/strong>So, make a decision after a careful assessment of your needs, risk appetite, and future goals. If you are unsure, you can also reach out to a financial advisor and get an expert\u2019s opinion. If you are investing through a robo advisor, its algorithm may automatically select one based on your input.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Place_the_trade_order\"><\/span>3. <strong>Place the trade order<\/strong>      <span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ETFs are traded like stocks for\nwhich you need to place an order. Once you have selected the ETF you wish to\ninvest in, you can execute the trade by placing the order. Now sit back,&nbsp; track your investment and watch it\ngrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_ETFs_should_I_invest_in\"><\/span><strong>What ETFs should I\ninvest in?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The selection for an ETF is\nsimilar to that of any other investment. The transaction costs, performance,\nrisk, type, etc., can together decide the ETFs you can invest in. There is no\nright or wrong answer here as your needs can differ from those around you. So,\nit may be advisable to consider the following factors when selecting an ETF:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Trading price:<\/strong>&nbsp;The trading price is the price of the ETF. This is\nsimilar to a stock price and will determine your total investment in an\nETF.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Expense<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>ratio<\/strong>:\nThe expense ratio is the administrative cost of investing in an ETF. This can\ndiffer for passively and actively managed funds. The former may be relatively\nlower and the latter higher. When looking for the&nbsp;best ETFs to invest in<strong>,&nbsp;<\/strong>make sure to compare the expense ratios and pick a fund with\nthe least cost.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Commission<\/strong>: Apart from the expense ratios, you also have to cover\nthe commission cost of investing in ETFs. A commission may be charged on every\npurchase or sale of an ETF through your brokerage account. This can vary for\ndifferent accounts.<\/li><li><strong>Performance<\/strong>: Needless to say, the performance of an ETF is an\nessential thing to focus on when investing in them. While the past performance\nmay not indicate the future performance, it can be a reflection of the fund and\nhelp you make a decision.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Volume<\/strong>: The volume is the number of shares traded over a\nperiod. The higher the volume, the more popular the fund and vice versa. This\ncan offer you a glimpse into what others are investing their money in.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Holdings<\/strong>: The holdings are the companies where the ETF invests\nthe pooled money from investors. Going through the list of holdings can give an\nidea of how well-diversified the ETF is.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Dividends<\/strong>: ETFs may pay you a dividend. You can check the past\ndividends to get an idea of the future dividends.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_much_to_invest_in_ETFs_per_month\"><\/span><strong>How much to invest\nin ETFs per month<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The value of an ETF investment\ncan be chosen based on your total investment budget. While EFTs offer excellent\ndiversification, they may also carry some risks. So, it may be advised to first\nsecure your future with traditional investment methods like a 401k, Individual\nRetirement Account (IRA), Health Savings Account (HSA), life insurance, and\nothers. If you do have some extra money that can be invested later, you can\nchoose ETFs. Moreover, of late, many 401ks offer ETFs. So, if you are already\ninvesting in ETFs through your company-sponsored 401k plan, you may not invest\nin them separately.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various scenarios that\ncan decide the value of your investment in an ETF. A financial advisor may be\nable to guide you in this regard.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Should_I_invest_in_mutual_funds_or_ETFs\"><\/span><strong>Should I invest in\nmutual funds or ETFs?<\/strong>&nbsp;<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few similarities between mutual funds and ETFs. However, there are also several differences. In principle, both investment options are entirely unique and can cater to various different needs. Here are some points to keep in mind when selecting either of the two:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_ETFs_may_be_cheaper\"><\/span>1. <strong>ETFs may be cheaper<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ETFs have lower expense ratios and transaction costs compared to mutual funds. So, this may be more cost-effective compared to mutual funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_ETFs_have_a_lower_minimum_investment_limit\"><\/span>2. <strong>ETFs have a lower minimum investment limit<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some mutual funds may have minimum investment requirements. This may not always be ideal for young investors who generally lack the funds to invest in high values. ETFs have no such conditions and can hence fit in any investment budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_ETFs_perform_only_as_well_as_the_index\"><\/span>3. <strong>ETFs perform only as well as the index<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since ETFs follow an underlying index, asset, or commodity, their performance is limited to the performance of their benchmark. They do not outperform the index they track. However, mutual funds are actively managed and hence can offer higher returns in several cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Commission-free_ETFs_may_not_always_follow_the_right_index\"><\/span>4. <strong>Commission-free ETFs may not always follow the right index<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With an influx of various ETFs in the market, many commission-free ETFs are tracking low-performing indices. While this may not be true for all ETFs, it is still good to check the index and then invest your money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_ETFs_can_be_more_flexible_and_liquid\"><\/span>5. <strong>ETFs can be more flexible and liquid<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An ETF can be bought and sold through your brokerage account. But mutual funds are generally purchased and redeemed through an Asset Management Company (AMC). Even though AMCs are very flexible, they do take a few days to confirm your mutual fund investment and redemption. However, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares, offering a higher level of flexibility, liquidity, and speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_ETFs_and_mutual_funds_can_both_be_risky\"><\/span>6. <strong>ETFs and mutual funds can both be risky<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though ETFs offer diversification, they can also be risky. If you select an ETF that tracks a sector, you may be exposing yourself to high risk and volatility. If the sector does not perform well, you may lose all your money. This is similar to sectoral and thematic mutual funds that can carry a lot of risks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain a well-diversified\nportfolio, it may be advised to invest in a combination of stocks, bonds, ETFs,\nmutual funds, etc. A heavy concentration in either can be harmful in the long\nrun. However, thoughtful investments across different asset classes and\ninvestment vehicles can together offer higher returns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Investing_in_ETFs_vs_stocks\"><\/span><strong>Investing in ETFs\nvs stocks<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ETFs and stocks can often\nconfuse investors. The two are traded in a similar manner, but the similarities\nend there. If you are investing in stocks, you invest in stocks of particular\ncompanies. For instance, you may have 50 stocks of five companies belonging to\ndifferent sectors with no connection to one another. However, an ETF will\ninvest in companies with a similar objective, for instance, the companies of\nthe same index or industry. Moreover, an ETF will invest in stocks of other\ncompanies. So, you will be able to invest in multiple stocks and companies at\nthe same time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, the\nsimilarities between stocks and ETFs include taxation, risks, and dividends.\nYour gains from an ETF and a stock will be taxed similarly as capital gains.\nMoreover, you can get dividends from stocks as well as ETFs. The risk quotient\ncan also be high in both depending on what you choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"To_conclude\"><\/span><strong>To conclude<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a better idea of&nbsp;how to invest in ETFs,&nbsp;you can consider making them a part of your investment portfolio and invest in them. Remember that the ultimate allocation or concentration of your funds in an ETF will depend on your goals and budget, as well as your other investments. However, if you are uncertain of where to begin or how to choose&nbsp;the best ETFs to invest in<strong>,<\/strong> you can reach out to a professional financial advisor in your area for better guidance and assistance on the matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for guidance on how to\ninvest in ETFs and diversify your investment portfolio,\nuse <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/match_advisors.asp\"><strong>WiserAdvisor\u2019s\nfree advisor match service<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>to find highly qualified and vetted fiduciary\nadvisors who can do the same for you.
