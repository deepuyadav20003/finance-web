										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estate planning is a multifaceted financial task that can feel overwhelming. It encompasses managing your financial assets and minimizing estate taxes as well as ensuring your loved ones are taken care of and content with their inheritance. On top of that, estate laws can change from time to time, which makes it essential to stay informed about the latest regulations.</p>
<p>If you are planning your estate in 2025, one of the smartest moves you can make is to work with a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=key_strategies_and_takeaways_for_navigating_estate_planning_in_2025?pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>financial advisor</strong></a> who can guide you through estate tax planning strategies and inheritance planning. This article will also walk you through key estate planning strategies to help you navigate this seemingly herculean task with ease in 2025.</p>
<h2><strong>Below are 5 estate planning strategies you may use in 2025:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Evaluate your estate&#8217;s value</strong></h3>
<p>Before making any estate planning decisions, you need to understand the total value of your estate. This includes all your assets, both liquid and non-liquid. Your bank accounts, real estate, businesses, collectibles, cars, and jewelry contribute to your estate&#8217;s worth. Some of these assets may have appreciated or depreciated since you bought them. Evaluating their current net worth will give you a clear picture of where you stand financially. Once you have an estimate of your estate&#8217;s value, determine which category you fall into. If you are a high-net-worth individual, your estate planning strategy will be different from someone with a smaller estate. This can help you make informed decisions, especially with the upcoming changes to federal estate tax laws.</p>
<p>The federal estate tax exemption is currently $13.99 million per person in 2025, but it is scheduled to drop to around $7 million in 2026. You could face significant estate tax liabilities if your estate&#8217;s value is close to or above this threshold. This makes 2025 a key year to act. If your estate may be taxable under the new limits, you may need to consider advanced estate planning strategies to minimize tax burdens. This could include setting up trusts to protect assets and reduce taxable estate size or gifting assets while the exemption is still high to transfer wealth tax-free, among other things.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Understand and use the new exemption limits to your benefit</strong></h3>
<p>There have been some changes in estate tax laws in 2025, which can help you maximize tax-free transfers. As stated above, the federal estate and gift tax exemption has increased to $13.99 million per person in 2025, up from $13.61 million in 2024. With this new change, you can transfer nearly $14 million tax-free during your lifetime or at death. The Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) tax exemption is also the same at $13.99 million per person in 2025. So, you can additionally pass wealth directly to your grandchildren or future generations without further tax consequences. It is important to take advantage of these higher limits this year as soon as you can, as the current law dictates that the exemption will drop to approximately $7 million per person in 2026. Leveraging the new limits can be one of the best <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/estate-planning-strategies-for-high-net-worth-individuals/">estate planning strategies</a></strong> for high net worth this year. If the exemption drops in 2026, estates worth between $7 million and $13 million could suddenly face hefty estate taxes. So, if you have a large estate, using this window now can be beneficial to transfer your assets without incurring higher tax burdens in the future.</p>
<p>You must also know about the annual gift tax exclusion that lets you transfer money or assets to other individuals each year without reducing your lifetime exemption. This exclusion has increased to $19,000 per recipient in 2025, up from $18,000 in 2024. The greatest benefit of using this exemption limit is that there is no limit to how many people you can gift, which makes it a simple way to transfer wealth without incurring taxes. For married couples, the benefits are even better. You and your spouse can split gifts, which allows you to give $38,000 per recipient tax-free. This can be a great option if you have multiple heirs or grandchildren. For example, say you have five heirs. You can move $190,000 out of your estate and give the money to all your heirs in a single year without touching your lifetime exemption. You also do not need to report these gifts to the IRS. So, prioritize making the most of this provision in 2025.</p>
<p>You can also consider a Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT) in 2025. A SLAT is a powerful tool for married couples looking to transfer assets while maintaining <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/retirement-planning/why-financial-planning-is-critical-while-planning-for-retirement/">financial security</a></strong>. Under SLAT, one spouse gifts assets into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the other. This removes the assets from their taxable estate while still allowing indirect access to the funds. With the current $13.99 million exemption, this is a great time to set up a SLAT. This way, you can ensure that any growth on the gifted assets happens outside of your taxable estate. Locking in the current high exemption now can provide significant long-term tax savings. If you wait until 2026, when the exemption may be cut in half, you could lose the chance to protect millions in wealth from future estate taxes.</p>
<p>Make sure that you use 2025 to plan ahead before the 2026 changes. Preparing now ensures your estate is structured as efficiently as possible. With the potential for a dramatic drop in the exemption limit in 2026, transferring assets in 2025 could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So, discuss these tax laws and how you can use them with your financial advisor as soon as you can.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Review your previous will and trusts</strong></h3>
<p>Reviewing your will and trusts regularly ensures they still reflect your wishes and that you take advantage of the latest tax laws. If your estate planning documents were created under older tax laws, they might not be as efficient today as they once were. In most cases, trusts are structured to optimize estate tax savings based on thresholds that existed when they were drafted. If these limits change, your trust may need updates to remain tax-efficient. This is the perfect time to revisit your estate plan and make necessary adjustments to your estate planning strategies to reduce estate taxes. Reach out to an estate planning attorney to understand how you can continue using your trust to maximize the current exemption before it decreases. You may also consider setting up new trusts if required. Additionally, if your will does not account for tax-free gifting strategies, now may be a good time to update it. The annual gift tax exclusion has increased to $19,000 per recipient in 2025. This allows you to transfer more wealth tax-free before the limits potentially lower. As a married couple, you can double the annual gift tax exclusion, gifting up to $38,000 per recipient in 2025 without triggering gift taxes.</p>
<p>Reviewing your estate plan also helps you understand how the latest federal estate laws affect you. For instance, some states impose their own estate or inheritance taxes, with exemption thresholds lower than the federal level. Review how the changes at the federal level impact your state&#8217;s rules and adjust your plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Your estate plan should also reflect any changes in your personal life. Marriage, divorce, losing a spouse, birth of children or grandchildren, etc., could necessitate updates to your will and trusts. If you have had a major life change, ensure your beneficiaries, guardians, and trustees align with your current wishes. For example, if you have recently welcomed a grandchild, you may want to add them as a beneficiary. If you have gone through a divorce, you might need to update or remove an ex-spouse as a beneficiary. After a divorce, you would also return to the individual gift tax exclusion of $19,000 per recipient in 2025. If you previously used a spousal gifting strategy, you may need a new plan to minimize taxes now.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Incorporate technology into your estate planning  </strong></h3>
<p>Technology can play a massive role in ensuring your estate is well organized. Several apps and online platforms allow you to create wills, health directives, and other essential estate planning tools from the comfort of your home or office. These apps are ideal for individuals just starting their estate planning journey and want a simplified way to get organized. Many estate planning apps and websites also feature real-time updates on changes to federal estate tax exemptions, gift tax limits, and other relevant laws. You can set up notifications about changes in tax laws, so you do not miss any crucial information. These tools also provide resources to help you understand how the new laws may impact your estate and what actions you should take. While not entirely comprehensive, these apps and websites can be a good way to start estate planning this year and educate yourself about the entire process.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Hire the right professionals for estate planning </strong></h3>
<p>Estate planning is a complex process, especially with frequent changes in tax laws and exemption limits. If you want to maximize current exemptions before they potentially reduce next year, you must implement suitable estate planning strategies carefully and accurately. Any mistakes you make now could cost you in the future if the opportunity to benefit from the current limits is missed. Hiring the right professionals can help you navigate these changes and implement them effectively, especially if you have a large estate, a complicated asset portfolio, or multiple heirs.</p>
<p>Understanding the nuances of estate taxes, exemption limits, and gifting strategies can be tricky. Implementing the best strategies to minimize your tax burdens requires a thorough understanding of how the tax system works. A qualified financial advisor can guide you through these processes and help you use the correct tools to minimize estate taxes.</p>
<p>The professional you choose should be selected based on the value and complexity of your estate. For instance, high-net-worth individuals may need the help of a specialized estate planning attorney who understands the intricacies of tax laws and the best ways to lower or avoid taxes using advanced approaches such as trusts or generation-skipping strategies. These strategies can help ensure the efficient transfer of wealth while minimizing the tax burden for both you and your heirs. Moreover, given the significant changes expected in the next year, hiring a professional can help you act promptly. A professional can ensure that your estate plan is aligned with the current laws and executed before any major shifts in the tax policy take effect.</p>
<p>When selecting a suitable professional for your estate planning, you must ensure that they are experienced and knowledgeable about the latest changes in tax laws and estate planning strategies. The professional should also have experience in handling estates similar to yours. For individuals with smaller and simpler estates, a financial planner may be sufficient for implementing tax-free gifting strategies, updating the will, and determining the best estate planning asset protection strategies. For larger estates, you might need a team of experts, including a tax professional and a wealth manager, who can work together to create a comprehensive plan based on your financial needs and goals.</p>
<h2><strong>To conclude</strong></h2>
<p>With the new changes in estate tax laws and upcoming adjustments slated for the next year, estate planning should be your top priority in 2025. You can start by using technology. Estate planning apps can help you get the basics in place and offer an accessible way to write a will, set up a trust, and create health directives. However, for more complex estate planning needs, you may have to consider hiring a financial advisor who can guide you through advanced estate planning strategies and help you with tax laws and exemptions. It is also important to stay informed about how these new rules may impact your estate, so you do not miss out on opportunities to minimize your tax liability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 529 plan is a savings tool that is typically used to save for a child or grandchild’s education expenses. Apart from parents and grandparents, other individuals like uncles, aunts, etc., can also use it.

Withdrawals for education purposes are not subject to federal or state taxes, and for K–12 students, you can withdraw up to $10,000 per year tax-free. In some states, contributors may even qualify for additional state tax benefits. These features make a 529 plan ideal not only for education planning but also for estate planning. A 529 plan can be an excellent estate planning tool if used properly.</p>
<p>A <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=how_to_incorporate_529_plans_into_your_estate_plan??pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advisor</a></strong> can help you understand the role of a 529 plan in estate planning. This article will also offer insights into how a 529 plan can fit into your estate plan.</p>
<h2><strong>Incorporating a 529 plan in estate planning </strong></h2>
<p>A 529 plan can be an estate planning tool with several advantages. All you have to do is open an account, name a beneficiary, and contribute to the plan. Over time, your funds will grow, and the plan can become a simple yet effective way to pass on wealth. Let’s take a closer look at some of the perks of using a 529 plan in estate planning:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Federal tax benefits </strong></h3>
<p>529 education plans are funded with your after-tax dollars. However, the earnings in a 529 plan grow on a tax-deferred basis. You do not pay taxes on the growth that your funds earn over the years. Additionally, it is entirely tax-free when the money is withdrawn for qualified educational expenses, such as college tuition, K–12 schooling (up to $10,000 annually), or vocational training. This combination of tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals not only makes 529 plans an excellent choice to save for education expenses but also for passing on your estate to your heirs.</p>
<p>Are 529 plans included in taxable estate? No, in fact, a 529 plan can considerably lower the taxable value of your estate. When you contribute to a 529 plan, the funds are considered completed gifts to the beneficiary. This offers two primary advantages. Firstly, you remain in control of the account. Secondly, the money is technically out of your estate when taxes are computed. As a result, the contributions you make, and the subsequent growth of those funds will not be counted when determining your estate’s value for taxation.</p>
<p>If you have a large estate and are likely to incur high estate tax, a 529 plan can be a brilliant way to reduce your estate tax liabilities. The account allows more of your wealth to go directly to your loved ones, as the funds can be passed on to beneficiaries without triggering taxes.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Flexible ownership</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike irrevocable trusts or other financial gifts, where you lose authority over the funds once they are transferred to the beneficiary, a 529 plan gives you complete control and ownership of the account. As the account owner, you can decide how the funds are used and make changes along the way to meet your family’s needs. For families with many members, a 529 plan can be used to pass on wealth to those other than your intended beneficiary, too. A 529 plan offers flexible ownership. Because you can change the plan’s beneficiary at any time, it allows you to align your savings with the educational needs of various family members. This can be useful in estate planning, as you get to use the plan to distribute assets across generations.</p>
<p>If the original beneficiary decides not to pursue higher education or receives a full scholarship, the account owner can transfer the plan to another eligible family member, such as other siblings, nieces, nephews, cousins, grandchildren, or even parents, without triggering penalties. This ensures that the funds saved are not wasted and can be used by someone who truly needs them. Imagine a scenario where you saved your children&#8217;s education in a 529 plan. One child receives a full scholarship, leaving the funds unused. Instead of withdrawing the money and facing penalties, you can transfer the plan to another child, grandchild, or other members pursuing higher education or attending a vocational program. This way, your savings can support your family’s educational goals without unnecessary taxes and penalties. Moreover, the plan will retain its tax advantages as long as the funds are used for qualified educational expenses.</p>
<p>Do note that you can also use the money for yourself. Say nobody in your family uses the money for education. In such a case, you can withdraw the funds for your financial needs. Keep in mind that since this would be a non-qualified withdrawal, it will trigger income taxes on the earnings portion and a 10% penalty. Despite this, the ability to access funds can offer you flexibility and peace of mind. You can use the money for retirement, buying a house, or simply enhancing your lifestyle.</p>
<h3><strong>3. State-wise tax advantages</strong></h3>
<p>529 plans not only offer federal tax benefits but can also provide state-level tax advantages that can enhance estate planning. Many states offer tax deductions and credits for 529 contributions. However, these benefits depend on where you live. For instance, nine states, including Florida, Nevada, Alaska, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, New Hampshire, Washington, and Wyoming, do not impose state income tax and, therefore, do not offer any tax deductions for 529 plan contributions. Similarly, California, Hawaii, and Kentucky assess state income tax but do not provide any tax deductions or credits for contributions to a 529 plan. On the other hand, many states offer attractive incentives. Alabama allows single filers to deduct up to $5,000 in contributions annually, while joint filers can deduct up to $10,000. Indiana provides a 20% tax credit on contributions, capped at a maximum credit of $1,500 per year. New Jersey provides a tax deduction of $10,000 per taxpayer, making it one of the more appealing states for 529 contributions. Kansas offers a smaller, yet still beneficial, tax credit of $150 for single filers and $300 for joint filers. However, it is essential to note that state benefits can vary widely. For instance, residents of states with no income tax will not see state-level deductions but can still enjoy federal benefits, including tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified educational expenses.</p>
<p>529 plans also have high aggregate contribution limits, which typically range between $235,000 and $550,000 per beneficiary, depending on the state. This makes them suitable for setting up tax-advantaged savings while reducing your estate’s taxable value over time. Once the aggregate limit is reached, no further contributions can be made, but the account continues to grow through investment earnings. This helps you maximize the plan’s potential without worrying about ongoing contributions. Moreover, contributions to a 529 plan can also help you reduce state-level estate or gift taxes. You can transfer funds into a 529 plan and shift wealth out of your estate while retaining control of how the funds are used. <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=how_to_incorporate_529_plans_into_your_estate_plan??pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consulting with a financial advisor</a></strong> or an estate planning attorney can help you understand the tax rules in your state so you can use a 529 plan more effectively.</p>

<h3><strong>4. No Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) tax</strong></h3>
<p>The GST tax prevents individuals from transferring wealth directly to their grandchildren or younger beneficiaries while avoiding federal estate taxes. This tax applies to gifts or inheritances passed to beneficiaries who are at least 37½ years younger than the donor, excluding spouses.</p>
<p>A 529 plan can help you eliminate GST tax concerns. These plans enable you to transfer wealth across generations, such as to grandchildren while bypassing immediate heirs. Not only does this help reduce the tax burden on larger estates, but it also ensures that your assets are passed on efficiently, and in a tax-advantaged manner.</p>
<h3><strong>5. No inheritance tax</strong></h3>
<p>Another benefit of using a 529 plan in estate planning is that beneficiaries may have the opportunity to exclude these accounts from state inheritance taxes, depending on the state and their relationship to the donor. Generally, close family members like children or grandchildren benefit from lower inheritance tax rates or even tax exemptions compared to more distant relatives who may be beneficiaries. Each state has its own rules, which are often based on the relationship between the deceased and the inheritor. Based on the relationship to the account holder, the state determines whether any inheritance tax applies and at what rate. In some states, funds in a 529 plan are specifically exempt from inheritance tax when passed to children or grandchildren. Certain states, like Pennsylvania, exempt in-state 529 plans from inheritance tax. However, plans from out-of-state may not be exempted.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Annual gift tax exclusion</strong></h3>
<p>While 529 plans have no specific annual contribution limits, your contributions are governed by federal gift tax rules, which makes them a useful tool for tax-efficient wealth transfer. In 2024, contributions up to $18,000 per beneficiary and $36,000 for married couples qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion. So, you can contribute up to these amounts without incurring any gift taxes. In 2025, this annual exclusion increases to $19,000 for individuals and $38,000 for couples.</p>
<p>A 529 plan also offers the option to superfund an account. This can be done through the five-year election. The superfund provision allows you to contribute up to five times the annual gift tax exclusion in a single year. This amounts to a total of up to $90,000 in 2024 and $95,000 in 2025. You can contribute up to these amounts without triggering any gift taxes. Married couples can double these amounts and contribute up to $180,000 in 2024 or $190,000 in 2025 per beneficiary. While this strategy can be beneficial for families looking to transfer a substantial amount of wealth quickly without incurring immediate gift tax implications, there are some things you must follow. When using the five-year superfund option, it is essential to note that you cannot make any additional gifts to the same beneficiary during the covered five-year period without potentially triggering gift taxes. For instance, if you superfund $95,000 in 2025, any other gifts to that beneficiary during the following five years will count against your lifetime gift tax exemption. The lifetime gift tax exemption limit has been increased to $13.99 million in 2025, up from $13.61 million in 2024.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this super funding option makes it easier for families to transfer large sums of money to the intended heir without incurring taxes. Moreover, these funds continue to grow tax-free over time, maximizing their value for future educational expenses. Additionally, as the account owner, you still retain most of the control. So, if you wish to change the beneficiary in the future or use the funds for your own needs, you can do so.</p>
<h2><strong>Things to keep in mind when using a 529 in estate planning</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Make sure to name a successor</strong></h3>
<p>Account owners need to name a successor for the 529 plan. This will ensure that the account does not go through probate upon the account owner’s demise. Probate can be a costly and lengthy affair. It can put families through a lot of emotional and financial strain. So, make sure to take the right steps in your estate planning to avoid probate later.</p>
<p>Naming a 529 plan successor ensures that the account is directly passed on to the beneficiary and used as intended. If the account owner passes away without naming a successor and there is no specific instruction for how the 529 funds are to be used in the will, the account may be tied up in probate. Successors have similar authority over the account as the original owner. Hence, naming a successor ensures that the account is managed well, and the wealth is transferred to the right person when the time comes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to choose a successor carefully, as this person will be able to change beneficiaries and withdraw funds (subject to tax and penalty rules for non-qualified expenses).</p>
<h2><strong>To conclude</strong></h2>
<p>While the primary goal of a 529 plan is to fund education expenses, its benefits extend beyond that. A 529 plan can also play a role in estate planning and help you reduce taxes and transfer wealth efficiently. However, the tax treatment of these plans varies from state to state. This makes it essential to understand your state’s specific regulations. To know the current tax rules applicable in your state, you can check your state’s Department of Revenue or Treasury website or consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estate planning refers to the management and distribution of an individual’s assets in the event of their incapacitation or death. It goes beyond just writing a will; it includes a variety of legal tools that help ensure your wishes are respected, minimize tax burdens, and provide a clear path for your loved ones to follow during emotionally challenging times.</p>
<p>Without proper estate planning, your assets could be subject to state laws, which may not align with your desires. According to a survey, only 33% of Americans have a will or an estate plan in place​. This lack of planning can lead to prolonged legal disputes, higher taxes, and the state deciding how your assets will be distributed.</p>
<p>An effective estate plan dictates how your assets will be divided and addresses key decisions about your health care and finances in case of incapacitation. By covering pre- and post-death scenarios, estate planning provides a comprehensive strategy to protect your assets, reduce taxes, and safeguard your family’s financial future. A <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=estate_planning_checklist_for_pre_and_post_death_planning?pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advisor</a></strong> can help create an exhaustive estate planning checklist to cover pre- and post-death planning and safeguard the financial well-being of your family members in your absence.</p>
<p>This article covers pre- and post-death actions you need to take and certain tips that will help make estate planning a smooth affair for your heirs.</p>
<h2>Below are certain estate-related actions that should be taken after your death:</h2>
<p>After a person passes away, the responsibilities shift to the executor and surviving family members to manage and distribute the estate. Here are key actions that need to be taken to ensure the smooth administration of the estate:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Probate</strong></h3>
<p>The probate process is the legal procedure in which the authenticity of the will left behind is validated and executed. After the individual&#8217;s death, the executor named in the will presents the document to the probate court. The court then oversees the process to ensure the will is legally valid and that the deceased’s assets are distributed according to their wishes. If there is no will, the estate is distributed according to state laws of intestacy, which can lead to outcomes that might not align with the deceased’s desires.</p>
<p>Probate is crucial because it provides an official forum for resolving any disputes or claims against the estate, such as challenges to the will or claims by creditors. While it is often seen as time-consuming, probate helps ensure that <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/8-ways-to-pass-on-an-inheritance/">asset distribution</a></strong> is orderly and legally binding.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Handling debts and bills</strong></h3>
<p>After death, outstanding debts and bills must be addressed by the estate. The executor is responsible for identifying all debts, including mortgages, loans, credit card balances, and utility bills. These obligations must be paid from the estate’s assets before anything is distributed to the heirs. If the estate’s funds are insufficient to cover the debts, creditors may not receive the full amount owed. However, beneficiaries generally do not inherit debts unless they are co-signers or jointly responsible for certain obligations.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Distribution of assets </strong></h3>
<p>Once the probate process is completed and all debts and expenses have been paid, the executor can begin distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries as outlined in the will. This involves transferring titles for property, distributing financial assets, and ensuring that any specific gifts or bequests are honored. The executor plays a critical role in ensuring that these transfers are done correctly, whether it involves distributing funds, real estate, or personal property.</p>
<p>The executor should keep detailed records of all distributions and provide a final accounting to the court (if required) to close the estate formally. Proper management ensures the beneficiaries receive their rightful inheritance and the estate is closed without further legal entanglements.</p>

<h2>Pre-death estate planning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take an inventory of assets: </strong>Start by making a detailed list of all your assets. This should include tangible assets like real estate, vehicles, jewelry, and valuable personal items, as well as intangible assets such as bank accounts, investments, retirement funds, life insurance policies, and digital assets (e.g., online accounts and passwords). Keeping an updated inventory helps avoid overlooked assets during estate distribution and makes it easier for your executor to manage your estate.</li>
<li><strong>Establish wills and trusts: </strong>Estate planning and wills go hand in hand. A will is essential for specifying how you want your assets distributed after your death. It also allows you to appoint guardians for minor children. However, in some cases, setting up a trust might be more beneficial. Trusts offer greater control over how and when beneficiaries receive their inheritance, can help avoid the probate process, and may offer privacy and tax benefits. Trusts can be especially useful if you have complex family dynamics or wish to support a minor or disabled dependent. It is important to understand the differences between both and make an informed decision. A financial professional can be an invaluable resource, who can take your unique circumstances into account and guide you on the right way to go about it.</li>
<li><strong>Designate beneficiaries and update based on changes in life circumstances: </strong>Many financial accounts, including life insurance policies and retirement accounts, allow you to designate beneficiaries. This ensures these assets are passed directly to your chosen individuals, bypassing the probate process. It’s important to review and update these designations regularly, especially after major life events such as marriage, divorce, or the birth of a child, to ensure that they align with your current wishes.</li>
<li><strong>Consider assigning powers of attorney: </strong>Assigning financial and medical powers of attorney ensures that someone you trust will manage your finances and make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated. The financial power of attorney manages your property, bank accounts, and other financial affairs, while the medical power of attorney makes decisions related to your health care. Establishing these documents early prevents last-minute legal hurdles and ensures your wishes are followed during difficult situations.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to tax planning:</strong> Minimizing estate taxes is a critical part of estate planning. Strategies such as gifting during your lifetime or establishing an irrevocable trust can help lower the tax burden on your estate. For example, the annual gift exclusion allows you to give away a certain amount of money tax-free every year (in 2024, this amount is $17,000 per person). By strategically gifting assets, you can reduce the value of your taxable estate.Additionally, setting up an irrevocable life insurance trust is a common tactic for avoiding estate taxes on large life insurance policies. This type of trust keeps the death benefit of your policy out of your taxable estate, which can be crucial for high-net-worth individuals.State-specific taxes can also impact estate planning. Some states have their own estate taxes or inheritance taxes, which apply even if you don’t meet the federal estate tax threshold. <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=estate_planning_checklist_for_pre_and_post_death_planning?pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Consulting with a tax professional</strong></a> can help ensure your estate plan optimizes tax efficiency and complies with federal and state tax laws.</li>
<li><strong>Make funeral arrangements well in advance: </strong>Planning your funeral can relieve your family of both emotional and <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/personal-finance/the-link-between-financial-stress-and-mental-health/">financial stress</a></strong>. By making decisions about burial or cremation, and possibly pre-paying for services, you ensure that your final wishes are respected and prevent potential disputes among your loved ones. You may consider pre-paid funeral plans to make the process fairly easy for you.</li>
<li><strong>Consider estate planning for your digital assets:</strong> This may seem unusual but the current digital age necessitates special attention towards digital assets while planning your estate. Without proper planning, accessing digital assets can be a legal gray area for your loved ones. These assets can include everything from social media accounts, email accounts, and cloud storage to cryptocurrency, intellectual property stored digitally, and even online bank accounts. It’s important to provide clear instructions for how these assets should be accessed, managed, or distributed after death. Many individuals fail to include these in their estate plans, leading to potential complications.For example, consider setting up a digital estate plan that designates a digital executor who will have the legal authority to access and manage your digital assets. Create a digital inventory that includes login credentials for important accounts. Some platforms, like Facebook, even allow you to designate a legacy contact who can manage your account after your death.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Important estate planning tips that you should not ignore</h2>
<p>Estate planning isn’t a one-time task; it requires regular attention to ensure it remains effective. Here are some practical tips to keep your estate plan up to date and avoid common pitfalls:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regularly review and update your plan: </strong>Your <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/6-things-you-should-know-to-create-a-robust-estate-plan/">estate plan</a></strong> should be a living document that evolves as your life changes. Major life events such as marriage, divorce, the birth of a child, or the purchase of a new home can significantly impact your estate planning needs. Regular reviews ensure that your will, trusts, and beneficiary designations reflect your current wishes. For example, a new child or grandchild might need to be added to your will, or an ex-spouse removed from a life insurance policy. Keeping these documents up to date prevents unintended consequences and legal complications down the road.</li>
<li><strong>Work with a professional: </strong>While it’s possible to create an estate plan on your own, working with an estate planning attorney or financial advisor is highly recommended. Professionals can help you navigate complex issues, such as tax laws and the proper structure of trusts, and ensure that your plan is legally sound. They can also help you avoid pitfalls like outdated wills, improper beneficiary designations, or neglecting state-specific legal requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>Estate planning helps to prepare for the inevitable. You can use it to protect your loved ones and ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes. Having a well-thought-out and updated estate plan can help provide financial security for your family, minimize taxes, and avoid the potential legal complications that can arise when no clear plan is in place. You may also hire a financial advisor for estate planning advice who can ensure you are on the right track and have a pre- and post-death planning checklist in place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estate planning is an essential part of securing your financial future that ensures your assets are distributed according to your wishes. Many regard it as a mere legal formality but it is more than just that. Estate planning allows you to leave your assets to your loved ones in a way that is hassle-free for them after considering the ensuing tax implications for the same.</p>
<p>At its core, estate planning involves several key elements: wills, trusts, and directives. A will is the foundational document that outlines who gets what after you pass away. Trusts, on the other hand, are more sophisticated tools that manage your assets both during your lifetime and after your death, offering benefits like tax advantages and avoiding probate. Directives encompass your healthcare wishes and designate who should make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so.</p>
<p>By proactively planning your estate, you create a clear, legally binding roadmap for the future. This ensures your wishes are honored and your family is taken care of, providing peace of mind for you and your loved ones. It&#8217;s about making informed decisions now to protect and manage your legacy for the future. A <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=right_time_to_start_making_an_estate_plan?pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>financial advisor</strong></a> can help create an estate plan according to your wishes and ensure that your legacy is protected.</p>
<p>But, when should a person begin estate planning? In this article, we will explore this important question along with the steps involved in the estate planning process.</p>
<h2>How estate planning evolves with life stages</h2>
<h3>1. Early adulthood: Basic will and healthcare directives</h3>
<p>Even if you’re just starting out, it’s important to have a basic will and healthcare directives in place. A will is the most straightforward tool in estate planning, and it’s often the first step. It allows you to specify how your assets should be distributed after your death. In your will, you can name beneficiaries, appoint guardians for minor children, and designate an executor to handle your estate. However, wills go through probate, which can be a lengthy and costly process.</p>
<p>You can also designate someone you trust to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. This ensures you have access to proper care and treatment even if <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/retirement-planning/how-to-build-a-retirement-plan-that-covers-your-healthcare-needs/"><strong>healthcare needs</strong></a> arise earlier than expected. Additionally, it makes way for seamless asset distribution per your wishes.</p>
<h3>2. Middle age: Comprehensive planning including trusts</h3>
<p>By middle age, you likely have more assets and responsibilities. This is the time to create a more comprehensive estate plan that may include trusts. A trust offers more advanced estate planning options. It allows you to manage and distribute your assets both during your lifetime and after your death. Types of trusts include revocable living trusts and irrevocable trusts, each with specific benefits and purposes. Trusts can help avoid probate, offer tax advantages, and provide greater control over how and when your assets are distributed. They are especially beneficial for those with significant or complex estates.</p>
<h3>3. Retirement age: Regular updates and reassessments</h3>
<p>As you approach retirement, it is now time to regularly update and reassess your estate plan. Changes in your financial situation, family dynamics, or health can all impact your estate planning needs. Regular updates ensure that your plan continues to reflect your current wishes and circumstances.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive approach to estate planning with various legal instruments</h2>
<p>Comprehensive estate planning is a holistic approach that goes beyond just creating a will or a trust. It involves a combination of legal documents and strategies to ensure all aspects of your estate are covered. This includes setting up a will and possibly one or more trusts, as well as establishing advance healthcare directives and financial powers of attorney. Comprehensive estate planning aims to minimize estate taxes, avoid probate, and ensure your healthcare and financial wishes are respected if you become incapacitated.</p>
<p>By understanding these tools and their differences, you can decide the best time and way to start making your estate plan. Whether you begin with a simple will or opt for a more complex trust, or you go for a comprehensive plan that covers all bases, starting early and updating regularly ensures your wishes are met and your loved ones are taken care of.</p>
<h2>Key life events to start or update your estate plan</h2>
<p>Responsibilities and priorities evolve with each life stage and so do estate planning needs. It is a good idea to keep estate planning in mind as life evolves. Below are some major milestones that mark the perfect times to begin your estate planning process or refine it.</p>
<h3>1. Savings account opening</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered what will happen to all the money in your savings account if something were to happen to you? While you may not want to think of the worst, it may be wise to prepare for it. Consider who should inherit your funds after you are gone. You can also change the beneficiaries at a later stage. Establishing this early helps set a strong foundation for your <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/financial-planning/top-insights-driving-financial-planning-strategies/"><strong>financial planning</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>2. Purchasing a home</h3>
<p>Buying a home is a significant investment and a major life milestone. Including your property in your estate plan ensures it will be distributed according to your wishes and can help avoid probate. This is also a good way to protect your dependents against life’s uncertainties.</p>
<h3>3. Marriage or partnership</h3>
<p>Entering a marriage or partnership often involves combining assets or deciding how to manage them separately. Updating your estate plan to reflect these changes ensures that your partner is provided for in the event of your death.</p>
<h3>4. Birth of children</h3>
<p>Your responsibilities multiply as you add more members to your family. The birth of a child may thus be an important time to update your estate plan. You’ll want to designate guardians for your children and ensure that your assets are managed in a way that supports their future needs. You may also define a care plan for your children and their education in event of your untimely passing.</p>
<h3>5. Receiving an inheritance</h3>
<p>Inheriting money or property may leave you elated but comes with an additional set of responsibilities. Updating your estate plan at this juncture can help you integrate your inheritance with your other assets. You may further define how you want it to be handled after you.</p>
<h3>6. Divorce or separation</h3>
<p>A divorce or separation significantly changes your financial situation. Updating your estate plan immediately after such events ensures that your ex-partner is no longer included in your estate and that your assets are distributed based on your current wishes.</p>
<h3>7. Birth of grandchildren</h3>
<p>The arrival of grandchildren is another milestone that may prompt an update to your estate plan. You may wish to include provisions for your grandchildren’s future needs and education.<br />

<h2>Below are the 7 steps in the estate planning process:</h2>
<h3>1. Creating an inventory of assets</h3>
<p>Start by listing all your assets. This includes both tangible and intangible items:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Tangible assets: </strong>These are physical items such as real estate, vehicles, jewelry, and collectibles.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible assets: </strong>These include bank accounts, stocks, bonds, retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and digital assets like cryptocurrency.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Addressing family needs</h3>
<p>Consider the needs of your family members and dependents:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Life insurance: </strong>Ensure you have sufficient life insurance to provide for your family’s financial needs in your absence.</li>
<li><strong>Guardians for dependents: </strong>If you have minor children, designate guardians who will care for them if you are no longer able to do so.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Establishing directives</h3>
<p>Set up legal directives to manage your affairs if you become incapacitated:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Durable power of attorney: </strong>Appoint someone to handle your financial matters.</li>
<li><strong>Medical directives: </strong>Specify your healthcare preferences and appoint someone to make medical decisions on your behalf through a living will or health care proxy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Reviewing beneficiaries</h3>
<p>Regularly update the beneficiaries on your financial accounts and policies:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Retirement plans and life insurance: </strong>Ensure that the designated beneficiaries on your accounts and policies are current and reflect your wishes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Understanding state laws</h3>
<p>Be aware of the laws in your state that affect your estate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Estate and inheritance taxes: </strong>Understand the tax implications for your estate and any potential liabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Community property considerations: </strong>If you live in a community property state, know how this affects the distribution of your assets.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6. Seeking professional assistance</h3>
<p>Consider the benefits of working with professionals. Attorneys and financial planners can provide expert guidance, ensure your estate plan is legally sound, and help you navigate complex issues.</p>
<h3>7. Regularly reassess your plan</h3>
<p>Regularly update your plan to reflect changes in your life circumstances, such as marriage, the birth of a child, divorce, or significant changes in your financial situation. Revisiting it every three to five years is ideal.</p>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>Estate planning isn&#8217;t just for the wealthy or the elderly; it&#8217;s a critical step for anyone who wants to ensure their assets are managed and distributed according to their wishes. Whether you&#8217;re just beginning your career, building a family, or approaching retirement, having a comprehensive estate plan provides peace of mind and security for you and your loved ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While a financial plan focuses on managing your finances during your lifetime, an estate plan is essential for determining the fate of your assets after you pass away. Estate planning involves the transfer of your assets to your heirs in the event of your passing. It outlines how your estate should be distributed and minimizes tax liabilities and legal complexities for your loved ones. Creating a robust estate plan can be an intricate process that requires attention to several legal, financial, and emotional considerations. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a comprehensive estate planning strategy.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=6_things_you_should_know_to_create_robust_estate_plan?pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>financial advisor</strong></a> can offer timely and personalized estate planning advice that can protect your assets and safeguard the financial well-being of your family members in your absence. This article will also help you understand how to do estate planning<strong> </strong>to ensure that you address all necessary aspects and create a foolproof plan that stands the test of time.</p>
<h2>Below are six things you should consider when creating a robust estate plan:</h2>
<h3>1. Estate planning is not a one-time thing</h3>
<p>One of the fundamental estate planning tips to remember is that estate planning is not a one-time event. An estate plan includes various elements, such as specifying how your assets are distributed, determining who inherits them, assigning percentages of inheritance to different individuals, and more. It also includes provisions like revocable and irrevocable trusts, powers of attorney, health directives, and designating guardians for minor or special needs children. All of these considerations are influenced by your personal dynamics and relationship statuses that are likely to evolve over time.</p>
<p>For instance, you might designate your sibling as the guardian for your minor children today. However, your relationship with your sibling could change tomorrow due to various life events such as relocation or personal differences. In such a scenario, updating your estate plan to include a new guardian who is willing and readily available becomes necessary. Similarly, if your executor becomes sick, incapacitated, or passes away untimely, you will need a replacement to ensure your estate plan is not affected. As your children transition into adulthood, their ability to manage their own assets will increase. You need to revise your estate plan to reflect their changing roles and responsibilities. Your children&#8217;s evolving needs and your relationship with them can also significantly impact the direction of your estate plan. For example, if you have a child with special needs, you may need to establish a special needs trust that provides for their long-term care. Sometimes, children drift away from their parents as they grow older. In such a case, you may or may not want to include them in your will.</p>
<p>Changes in your marital status, such as marriage or divorce, also warrant updates to your estate plan and will. In the event of a divorce, you may remove your former spouse as a beneficiary and designate someone else. Conversely, getting married may prompt you to add the new spouse and their children, if any, to your estate plan to provide for them. Moreover, significant financial changes, such as acquiring new assets, such as a home or selling existing ones, such as a collectible, require a review of your estate plan. For example, if you purchase real estate or invest in gold, you need to ensure that these assets are suitably accounted for and distributed according to your wishes in your absence.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is crucial to view estate planning as an ongoing process. You can regularly review your estate plan, perhaps every few years, to ensure that it remains aligned with your individual and family needs. Additionally, major life events or financial changes also need immediate reassessment. Each milestone necessitates adjustments to your estate planning documents to ensure all your assets and personal dynamics are well accounted for.</p>
<h3>2. Beneficiaries must match on all your accounts</h3>
<p>One of the most overlooked aspects of retirement and estate planning<strong> </strong>is ensuring consistency among the names of your beneficiaries. Typically, all accounts and investments require a designated nominee. For example, your employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, Individual Retirement Account (IRA), 529 education savings account, mutual fund investments, bonds, and life insurance policies all have fields for specifying beneficiaries. In the event of your unfortunate passing, the designated beneficiary of each account is entitled to the funds within that account. However, discrepancies can arise when the beneficiary named on an account differs from the beneficiary named in your will. For instance, you might designate your spouse as the beneficiary of your 401(k) plan but specify your child as the beneficiary in your will for the same account. In such cases, the funds within the account will be disbursed to the beneficiary named on the account and not the one on your will. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure consistency in beneficiary designations at all times.</p>
<p>If you establish an account first and create your will later, you need to ensure that the same person is named as the beneficiary in both places. Often, individuals set up their 401(k) plans early in their careers when they may not yet be married or have children. However, as their relationship dynamics evolve with changes in marital status or parenthood, they may forget to update beneficiary designations on their accounts. While the correct beneficiary may be named in the will, this alone is insufficient. It is imperative also to update beneficiary designations on the account itself.</p>
<p>As time passes, many people tend to forget about these important details. Therefore, it is helpful to maintain a comprehensive list of all nominees and accounts. This makes it easier to monitor your investments and assets. Whenever you open a new account or make changes to existing investments, it is essential to review and ensure alignment between the designated nominees and your will. Additionally, it is vital to communicate your nominations to the designated beneficiaries to enable them to pursue the account proactively in the event of your absence. This practice not only fosters transparency but also ensures that your wishes are carried out effectively.</p>
<h3>3. Estate planning goes beyond just a will</h3>
<p>Estate planning is a multifaceted approach. Many people mistakenly equate it solely with creating a will. However, it is important to understand that a will is just a part of estate planning. A will is a document that serves as a legal instruction on what happens to your assets. For instance, if you have $1 million, you can specify that each of your three children and spouse gets $250,000 each. However, your estate plan will also include other things.</p>
<p>To begin with, your <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/estate-planning-strategies-for-high-net-worth-individuals/">estate planning strategy</a></strong> can include your health directives. Health directives help you decide what happens if you are incapacitated. End-of-life situations, such as patients in vegetative states, render them unable to voice their preferences. At such a time, the health directives they set up are consulted to decide the next course of action. Two key elements in this regard are a living will and a health power of attorney. A living will specifies your medical treatment preferences, including pain management, and when these wishes apply, such as circumstances for organ donation, coma, brain inactivity, etc. This ensures that your body is dealt with as you wish and not left to the judgment of your family members or doctors, which may or may not align with your needs. A health power of attorney appoints a person to make decisions on your behalf in unforeseen situations like accidents.</p>
<p>Similar to the health power of attorney is the financial power of attorney. This appoints an administrator to handle financial matters on your behalf in case of your incapacitation. Various provisions, such as gift-making authority and property decisions, fall under the financial power of attorney&#8217;s purview. Given the significant authority granted to these persons, it is essential to choose them wisely. Appointees must be trustworthy and reliable. They should be unbiased and have your best interests at heart. You must also keep reviewing your powers of attorney. And, if you revoke or cancel old powers of attorney, then you must inform these people to ensure transparency at all times.</p>
<p>Another critical component of an estate plan is a trust. Trusts give you power over your assets and enable you to decide precisely how they should be used. There are different types of trusts, the most common ones being revocable and irrevocable trusts. A revocable trust is flexible and lets you change the terms at any time as per your wishes. For instance, if you establish a revocable trust for a child, granting access at the age of 25, but they require funds earlier for education, you can adjust the terms accordingly. On the other hand, an irrevocable trust cannot be revised after it is created without the beneficiaries&#8217; consent or court approval. In such a case, if the child needs the funds sooner, you will need their consent and approval from the court.</p>
<p>All of these components are necessary parts of financial planning, and only when incorporated together, can you fully recognize all estate planning benefits.<br />

<h3>4. Not making an estate plan will lead to probate</h3>
<p>If you do not have an estate plan, the government usually steps in to take control of your estate. This process is known as probate. Probate essentially means that your estate undergoes a supervised process in court, after which it is decided how your assets will be distributed among your heirs. In this process, the court appoints an individual administrator to take charge of your estate. If you have any pending fees, debt, taxes, or penalties, the court uses your estate to pay these off. The remaining amount is then distributed among your heirs. When an estate undergoes the probate process, priority is usually given to your immediate family, including your spouse and children. In the case of larger families, the court may favor the first spouse and children, potentially overlooking other marriages or alternative estate plans you may have had.</p>
<p>While probate is an impartial process, with no bias or devious intentions from third parties, it does impose hassles on your family. Firstly, your intended loved ones may not receive a share of your estate as you wish. Even if they receive something, it may not necessarily be in the proportions you desire. Moreover, probate is a lengthy process, which can last up to a year in some cases. This can be inconvenient, primarily if your family members reside in different parts of the country or world. If your estate goes through probate, your family will also need to hire a probate attorney to represent them in court, which can be expensive. In some cases, families can pay up to 10% of the total estate&#8217;s value on probate. Furthermore, probate can lead to mental stress. Your family members may engage in disputes, leading to feuds and resentment. This stress can strain their relationships. Additionally, there is a risk of your personal, professional, and financial information becoming public. Moreover, the process of probate may differ from state to state, depending on the state laws on estate, property, and inheritance tax.</p>
<p>While probate can be a cumbersome and stressful process for your loved ones, it can be avoided with proper estate planning. Estate plans undergo probate when there is no will, so it is crucial to make one. The will should be as clear as possible, stating the exact shares and percentages for asset distribution. If you are not leaving something to someone, make sure to mention that, too. The more transparent and precise the will, the fewer chances there are for family members to dispute and for your estate to undergo probate.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have a will but some of your assets are left out, the probate process will still apply to those assets. Any asset that still has your name without a designated beneficiary will undergo probate. Hence, it is imperative to be as detailed as possible in your will.</p>
<h3>5. Taxes apply to your estate</h3>
<p>In 2022, an estimated 7,600 total estate tax returns were filed, of which 3,900 were taxable. The total estate tax liability for the year amounted to $22.7 billion. In 2023, there were an estimated 7,100 total estate tax returns and 4,000 taxable returns. The estate tax liability increased to $24.0 billion in the same year.</p>
<p>Taxes should be a prime consideration in your estate planning strategy as they can take a large cut out of your estate. Therefore, you must understand how these will be levied to ensure you plan and prepare well and leave an estate your heirs can benefit from. Estate tax is imposed on the estate and is paid before assets are distributed to beneficiaries, while inheritance tax is levied on individuals who inherit the estate. The estate tax is a federal tax, but several states also impose it, including Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Illinois, Maryland, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, and Hawaii. On the other hand, inheritance tax is not a federal tax but is imposed in some states, including Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Maryland is the only state in the U.S. to impose both estate and inheritance tax.</p>
<p>While estate and inheritance tax are inevitable, you can avoid or minimize them with the right strategy. Here are some estate planning tips<strong> </strong>to avoid taxes:</p>
<p><strong>a. Transfer your assets before death: </strong>If possible, you may transfer some of your assets before death under the gift exemption. The government allows you to transfer some of your assets to another individual up to a fixed limit each year. This is known as the gift tax exemption. In 2023, the annual gift exclusion stood at $17,000, allowing you to gift up to this amount to another person without incurring gift tax. This exclusion has been increased to $18,000 in 2024. Moreover, these gifts are separate from and in addition to your lifetime estate tax exemption, which was $12.92 million in 2023 and has been increased to $13.61 million in 2024. Understanding these allowances is essential for effective estate planning and maximizing the transfer of assets to your beneficiaries while minimizing tax liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>b. Purchase a life insurance plan:</strong>Life insurance secures the financial future of your loved ones. It offers a guaranteed payout to your loved ones in your absence. Upon death, these plans give your beneficiary a pre-determined amount. This amount, even if paid in a lump sum, is generally exempt from any tax. This means that your heirs will not owe any inheritance tax on the payout received from your insurance plan and will get to keep the entire sum for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>c. Move to a state without estate or inheritance tax: </strong>Tax laws differ in different states. Moving to a state with no taxes can significantly help you lower your overall tax liabilities on your estate. If you and your heirs live in tax-free states, you can retain more of your estate and pay minimal tax.</p>
<p><strong>d. Use a Roth IRA: </strong>The funds in a Roth IRA can be passed down to your heir without incurring any estate tax. This is an effective way to pass on funds without incurring any tax. Instead of leaving money in your will, you can use a Roth account to do the same.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Hiring a financial advisor can simplify the estate planning process</strong></h3>
<p>Estate planning is a broad subject encompassing multiple considerations, such as tax and legality. Therefore, hiring a financial advisor can be instrumental in the process. A financial advisor can offer helpful<strong> </strong>estate planning tips to ensure your plan is foolproof. They can help you understand the tax laws in your state and how they apply to your estate. They can recommend gifting strategies, the use of Roth accounts, and more, and assist you in choosing the best course of action based on your individual circumstances.</p>
<p>Financial advisors specializing in estate planning can help draft a suitable will that covers all your assets. They ensure that nothing is overlooked, and everything is accurately accounted for. With their expertise and experience, you can minimize the chances of errors, enhance transparency, and lower the probability of your will undergoing probate. This not only alleviates stress for your loved ones but also reduces legal fees and safeguards your hard-earned assets. Moreover, financial advisors can assist in setting up trusts tailored to your financial needs. They help you select a suitable trust that protects your assets and ensures the financial well-being of your inheritors. They can explain the use and purpose of multiple trusts and enable you to select an option that best reflects your needs and those of your loved ones. Additionally, they can assist in creating power of attorneys &#8211; both financial and health &#8211; to ensure that all end-of-life decisions align with your preferences. This can facilitate smooth and prompt decision-making during critical times.</p>
<p>Hiring a financial advisor can also provide peace of mind, knowing that your estate will be managed effectively and will be rightfully passed on to its inheritor after your demise.</p>
<h2><strong>To conclude</strong></h2>
<p>Estate planning is surrounded by many misconceptions. Some believe it is only for the wealthy, while others think it should only be done after retirement when one is older and approaching the end. However, estate planning applies to everyone. It is a crucial component of personal finance that should never be ignored. Considering the unpredictability of life, securing your loved ones is essential, and estate planning helps you do this effectively. Therefore, aim to do so as soon as possible.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High-net-worth individuals who possess a significant number and value of assets and complex financial portfolios may find it hard to manage their finances. However, given the high value of wealth, it becomes all the more critical for high-net-worth individuals to plan their finances optimally. Estate planning is one of the key components of financial planning these individuals need to focus on. It is a process that can allow high-net-worth individuals to transfer their wealth to future generations while minimizing tax burdens, maximizing financial security, and protecting their hard-earned money. A <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=estate_planning_strategies_for_high_net_worth_individuals&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>financial advisor</strong></a> can help these individuals employ tailored strategies to maintain control over their assets, mitigate tax consequences, provide for their loved ones, and more. This article discusses some essential<strong> </strong>estate planning strategies for high-net-worth<strong> </strong>individuals to ensure financial security and a smooth transfer of their assets.</p>
<h3>Estate planning challenges faced by high-net-worth individuals</h3>
<p><strong>Here are some top challenges that you may face as a high-net-worth individual when creating an estate plan:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Wealth preservation: </strong>Preserving wealth for future generations is a crucial objective for high-net-worth estate planning. With the increased risk involved, the need to strike the right balance between risk and return is essential. Wealth preservation can be challenging when transferring assets from one generation to another. Inheritance tax, <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/minimize-estate-taxes-with-proper-estate-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estate tax</a>, inflation, market volatility, as well as your beneficiary&#8217;s personality, habits, and attitude towards money, can determine what happens to your wealth after your demise.</p>
<p><strong>2. Business succession: </strong>Many high-net-worth individuals are business owners. Transferring ownership and transitioning the business to new management can be a significant challenge. Business successions have been the cause of major family feuds and business failures. Therefore, it is essential to plan well, maintain clear communication with your family members and potential successors, be transparent with your workforce, and establish the correct protocols.</p>
<p><strong>3. Asset protection: </strong>High-net-worth individuals are at a greater risk of facing theft, lawsuits, legal claims, creditor issues, etc. They may also have trouble retaining their assets in personal situations, such as divorce. This makes asset protection a significant concern. However, there are ways to eliminate these risks. Revocable and irrevocable trusts, insurance plans, Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT), and other similar <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/estate-planning-strategies-for-high-net-worth-individuals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estate planning strategies</a></strong> for high-net-worth<strong> </strong>individuals can be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>4. Family dynamics</strong>: High-net-worth families may have complex family structures. In many cases, high-net-worth individuals may include other family members, such as their spouses, siblings, children, etc., in their work endeavors. This can create disruption if the people involved have their own vested interests at heart. In addition, blended families, multiple marriages, and children from different marriages can be hard to plan for in estate planning. It is vital to address these family dynamics and ensure a just, fair, and equitable distribution of your assets to mitigate potential conflicts and ensure a smooth transition of wealth.</p>
<p><strong>5. Managing global assets: </strong>High-net-worth individuals are more likely to have global assets and investments. Estate planning can be hard to navigate with international laws, global market fluctuations, tax treaties, and legal systems. It is essential to comply with regional regulations and laws the assets are placed in, follow cross-border tax rules, etc., to ensure that your beneficiaries can inherit your estate without any hassles.</p>
<p><strong>6. Handling Estate tax</strong>: Tax liabilities can be enormous for high-net-worth individuals. They can erode a significant portion of your wealth in the transfer process. It is essential for you to plan well and follow different <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/estate-planning-for-persons-with-large-retirement-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-net-worth estate planning strategies</a> to save on tax and not extend its burden to your inheritors. There are several ways to minimize tax, such as establishing trusts, gifting, etc., and estate planning can help you discover these.</p>
<h2>Here are 4 estate planning strategies for high-net-worth individuals to consider:</h2>
<h3>1. Create a trust to protect your wealth</h3>
<p>One of the most effective ways to protect a high-net-worth estate is by establishing a trust. Trusts offer a range of benefits, including asset protection, privacy, and efficient wealth transfer. You can use a trust to distribute your wealth and assets to your designated beneficiaries without getting into the hassles of probate. Two of the most commonly used trusts are revocable living trusts and irrevocable trusts. Revocable living trusts allow the creator of the trust to retain complete control of the trust during their lifetime. When you set up a revocable living trust, you can change the terms and conditions of the trust, update the names of the beneficiaries, manage the assets or funds within the trust, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, irrevocable trusts cannot be modified or changed. They are usually used after the passing of the estate owner. However, in some cases, you can appoint a successor trustee who will manage the trust on your behalf. All revocable living trusts become irrevocable after the death of the owner.</p>
<p>It can be confusing to choose the correct option, which is why it may be advised to hire a financial advisor to have better clarity on the matter. Generally, the primary difference between the two types of trusts lies in the level of control and flexibility they offer. Revocable living trusts allow you to make adjustments and changes as your situations and circumstances evolve. They may be suitable for people with complex family dynamics that are likely to change over time and lead to legal alterations. Contrarily, irrevocable trusts offer more permanence. They are ideal for protecting your assets in the long run. An irrevocable trust is more rigid in its structure. You have to relinquish your control, but you enjoy complete security from creditors, potential lawsuits, etc.</p>
<p>If your goal is to preserve wealth, you benefit more from an irrevocable trust. But if you need more flexibility, it may be advised to choose a revocable trust. Having said that, the specific type of trust will depend on your income, assets, individual circumstances, financial goals, and estate planning objectives.</p>
<h3>2. Choose the right trustee for managing and distributing trust assets</h3>
<p>When it comes to estate planning, selecting the right trustee can make all the difference. A trustee plays a crucial role in managing your assets and investments and ensuring your wishes are fulfilled in your absence. A trustee is a person or organization who can be appointed to manage and distribute trust assets according to the terms and conditions outlined in the trust agreement. A trustee is legally obligated to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries and the trust fund owner. They must abide by the trust&#8217;s provisions, maintain proper records, and carry out your wishes with integrity.</p>
<p>It is essential to appoint someone who will act in your best interests and fulfill their fiduciary duties towards your estate. Make sure to conduct thorough research and evaluate the trustee&#8217;s track record and reputation before entrusting someone with your estate. It is also important to have open and honest communication with the trustee and convey all your financial goals and desires. It is also essential to choose a trustee who is likely to outlive you. Additionally, you must appoint a primary and a secondary trustee. In the event the primary trustee passes away, is incapacitated, retires, or is no longer able to fulfill their duties, the secondary trustee can step in.<br />

<h3>3. Use tax-saving strategies to save money</h3>
<p>Apart from preserving your wealth, it is also vital to minimize secondary costs like taxes. High-net-worth individuals can have considerable cash balances, high-value investments, and costly assets like gold, diamonds, collectibles, cars, homes, etc., all of which can lead to significant estate tax burdens if not carefully managed. Therefore, it is important to implement effective estate planning strategies and take advantage of various tax reductions to ensure the efficient transfer of wealth to future generations.</p>
<p>One effective strategy to do this is through lifetime gifting. Gifting assets to your beneficiaries during your lifetime can reduce the overall value of your taxable estate. The annual gift tax exclusion allows you to give away a part of your estate up to a certain amount without incurring any taxes. As of 2023, you can claim a lifetime gift tax exemption of $12.92 million. This is only for one person. In the case of couples, both spouses can gift up to a total of $25.84 million. An important thing to remember is that the lifetime gift tax exemption will drop to $6 million by 2026. So, it may be advised to gift your assets to your beneficiaries before this to claim a higher exemption. You can also save on federal taxes if your estate is valued at up to $12.92 million in 2023. The federal estate tax is only levied on estates that are worth more than $12.92 million in the case of individuals and $25.84 million for married couples.</p>
<p>Other ways to lower your taxes include charity. Gifts made to charities approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are tax-free. You can also make a donation gift to a political organization tax-free. Some more examples of tax-free gifts include a gift to your spouse as long as they are a U.S. citizen, a gift to cover someone&#8217;s tuition paid directly to the educational institution, and a gift to pay for someone&#8217;s medical expenses paid directly to the medical facility.</p>
<h3>4. Consider high-net-worth life insurance during estate planning</h3>
<p>Life insurance offers several unique benefits and serves as a valuable tool in protecting your assets and maximizing the value of your estate. The life insurance proceeds paid to your beneficiary in the unfortunate event of your death are generally not included in their gross income and are not taxed. This makes life insurance one of the best ways to secure your loved ones financially. Moreover, life insurance benefits are paid in cash. Your beneficiaries can receive the money in a lump sum or installments. Because high-net-worth individuals often have a substantial portion of their wealth tied up in illiquid assets, such as real estate, businesses, or investments, life insurance can offer a lot of quick liquidity.</p>
<p>Life insurance policies can be chosen and structured to provide different coverage amounts, policy durations, and premium payment options. This allows you to select multiple plans depending on your goals and name different beneficiaries, such as your spouse and children, and ensure your family&#8217;s overall financial security.</p>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>High-net-worth estate planning comes with a unique set of challenges. The estate tax exposure is high, preserving a significant amount of wealth is hard, managing business successions can be time-consuming, and protecting assets from lawsuits and creditors can be complicated. High-net-worth individuals can also have philanthropic goals, complex family dynamics, and global investments, making it harder to navigate matters. However, developing comprehensive high-net-worth estate planning strategies with the guidance of an experienced financial advisor can help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estate and inheritance planning offers the opportunity to create a lasting legacy while also ensuring the financial security of your heirs. However, passing on an inheritance can be complex and requires careful consideration to ensure that the wishes of the deceased are met, while also ensuring the interests of beneficiaries are protected. Although a will is the standard method of transferring assets, there are several other ways to do so, such as trusts, joint ownership, gifting, and more.</p>
<p>A financial advisor can offer guidance on how to transfer assets through an inheritance. They can also help with tax planning, ensuring that the transfer of assets is done in a way that minimizes tax liability for both the estate and the beneficiaries. Professional advisors and estate planners can also help navigate complex legal and financial issues related to inheritance. Consider <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=8_ways_to_pass_on_an_inheritance&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>consulting with a professional financial advisor</strong></a> who can help ensure that your inheritance is passed on to your beneficiaries as per your wishes.</p>
<p>This article discusses eight ways you can pass on an inheritance so you can help determine the best approach for passing assets to your heirs before their death, or after their demise.</p>
<h2>How to pass on an inheritance<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>There are several ways through which you can pass on an inheritance. These are:</p>
<h3>1. Create a will</h3>
<p>A will is a legal document documenting how a person&#8217;s assets will be distributed after their demise. The will specifies the beneficiary, the portion or amount they shall receive, and any other conditions that need to be met. It can also name an executor who will manage any estate and carry out the instructions outlined in the will.</p>
<p>That said, laws pertaining to wills may vary from state to state and drafting a will may not guarantee that your assets are distributed according to your wishes.</p>
<p><strong>There are primarily three types of inheritance laws:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. Common law</strong><strong>: </strong>Under common law, marital assets are not automatically split equally between spouses in the event of death. However, some states provide the surviving spouse with a right to claim a portion of the deceased&#8217;s estate even if it goes against the will, provided they file a petition with the court. Common law also states that the ownership of property is determined by the titleholder or the source of funds used to acquire it.</p>
<p><strong>b. Community property:</strong> As per community property law, each spouse is automatically considered to own half of what was earned during the marriage and upon death, half of the deceased&#8217;s estate goes to the surviving spouse. This law is enforced in 9 states namely, Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. However, the deceased can choose to leave more than half of their assets to their spouse through a will. Property acquired during a marriage or any income earned is considered shared for inheritance purposes. On the other hand, any property acquired before marriage or after legal separation, inheritance, gifts, or assets kept separate are excluded.</p>
<p><strong>c. Elective community </strong><b>property: </b>Alaska, Tennessee, and Kentucky are three states that have different inheritance systems than common law and community property. These states have an elective community property system that enables spouses to inherit automatically by creating a written agreement and a community property trust with their partner. Residents and non-residents can establish community property through a trust in these states. This unique inheritance system grants equal ownership rights to both spouses on any property acquired during the marriage, including income from work, inheritances, and gifts. The agreement can also specify the distribution of property in the event of a spouse&#8217;s death.</p>
<h3>2. Set up a trust</h3>
<p>Trusts are a highly popular option for passing on inheritance because they offer greater control over the distribution of assets to beneficiaries. By establishing a trust, you can specify how and when your assets will be distributed to your beneficiaries. This is especially beneficial if you have concerns about your beneficiaries&#8217; financial management skills or if you want to protect your assets from creditors. It may be wise to appoint a trustworthy financial advisor or company to manage the trust for you and oversee distributions.</p>
<p><strong>There are several trust types that can be used for inheritance planning. The four primary types of inheritance trusts include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revocable living trusts</strong><strong>:</strong> These trusts allow the grantor to retain control over the assets during their lifetime. The grantor can change or revoke the trust or the assets at any time. Upon the grantor&#8217;s death, the assets in the trust are distributed to the beneficiaries named in the trust.</li>
<li><strong>Irrevocable trusts</strong><strong>: </strong>The grantor cannot change or revoke these trusts once they are created. The assets in the trust are transferred out of the grantor&#8217;s estate, which can reduce estate taxes. There are several types of irrevocable trusts, such as irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs), charitable trusts, and special needs trusts.</li>
<li><strong>Testamentary trusts</strong><strong>:</strong> These trusts are created through a person&#8217;s will and go into effect upon their death. The assets are distributed to the trust, which is managed by a trustee for the benefit of the beneficiaries mentioned in the will.</li>
<li><strong>Charitable trusts</strong>: These trusts are created to benefit a charitable organization or cause. There are several types of charitable trusts, such as charitable remainder trusts and charitable lead trusts. These trusts can offer tax benefits to the grantor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trusts are most commonly used to pass on an estate to children, in which case a revocable trust is ideal. If you have a large amount of wealth that you want to pass on to your children, consult your financial planner about setting up a trust that can automatically be passed on to your heirs after your demise.</p>

<h3>3. Add a joint owner</h3>
<p>If you have a property that you want to pass on to a specific individual, adding them as joint owners of the property is one way to accomplish this. By doing so, they automatically inherit the property upon your demise since they are part owners.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s essential to consider the legal and tax implications of joint ownership. If you don&#8217;t want the beneficiary to have any control over the property while you&#8217;re alive, joint ownership may not be the best option since it grants them a certain amount of control over the property. Additionally, owning a property involves indirect costs like taxes and maintenance expenses. It is advised to consult an attorney or a financial advisor before making this decision.<br />

<h3>4. Invest in a retirement account</h3>
<p>Passing on assets as inheritance can be made easy by investing in a tax-free retirement plan. Employer-sponsored tax-deferred retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s, are among the most popular options. If you&#8217;re already contributing to one of these accounts, <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=8_ways_to_pass_on_an_inheritance&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>consider speaking with a financial advisor</strong></a> about maximizing your investment.</p>
<p>Although these accounts are intended for retirement, they allow you to designate a beneficiary, making them an effective way to pass on an inheritance. Upon your passing, the assets saved under your retirement account can be transferred to your beneficiary without undergoing the probate process. Your beneficiary will have several options for managing the inherited funds, including rolling the IRA or 401(k) into their account, transferring the funds directly to their bank account, or leaving the account as-is to continue growing. However, note that leaving the assets untouched for more than ten years will require withdrawing the full amount.</p>
<h3>5. Consider giving gifts</h3>
<p>Giving inheritance in the form of gifts can be a good idea if you have financial leverage. Gifting assets to your beneficiaries during your lifetime can help reduce the size of your estate and lower the tax burden for your heirs. Currently, the annual gift tax exclusion is $17,000, which means you can give a gift equal to that amount without incurring a gift tax. However, it is advised to consult with a professional who can help you understand the gift tax regulations before you give a large amount of money as a gift, as the beneficiaries may face capital gains taxes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re gifting to children or grandchildren, establishing a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) account can be beneficial. These accounts are custodial savings accounts for minors, and the assets are transferred to the beneficiaries once they reach legal age. UTMA accounts can hold any asset, while UGMA accounts only contain financial assets. Setting up these accounts can be tax-efficient since the beneficiaries will be taxed at a lower rate on their gifts.</p>
<h3>6. Buy a life insurance policy</h3>
<p>Life insurance policies can be another way to pass on an inheritance. There are two primary types of life insurance: term and permanent. Term life insurance provides coverage for a specified period, while permanent life insurance provides coverage for the duration of your life. The major con associated with term insurance is that if you outlive the designed period, no payout shall be made to your beneficiary.</p>
<p>When you purchase a life insurance policy, you designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who will receive the death benefit. The death benefit is typically tax-free however, the life insurance payout in some states may attract taxes. Do consult with your advisor before making any decision.</p>
<h3>7. Make charitable donations and set up a special needs trust</h3>
<p>Charitable donations are one of the most popular ways to pass on an inheritance and lower the tax burden on your estate. Charitable donations can be made through your will or trust, or you can set up a charitable foundation in your name.</p>
<p>In addition, if you want to pass your inheritance to a loved one with special needs, you can set up a special needs trust. This type of trust allows for the transfer of assets without affecting the individual&#8217;s eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income. To establish a special needs trust, it&#8217;s crucial to consult with an experienced attorney who can help set up the trust, select a trustee, and create a detailed plan for using the trust funds. The trustee will manage and use the funds to provide for the individual&#8217;s needs, such as medical care, housing, and transportation. Setting up a special needs trust ensures that your loved one with special needs is taken care of for years to come.</p>

<h3>8. Establish an education fund</h3>
<p>Creating an education fund can be a good way to pass your inheritance and invest in your loved ones&#8217; future education. There are various ways to establish an education fund, such as setting up a trust with your intended beneficiaries or opening a 529 college savings plan, which allows for tax-free growth of funds as long as the money is used for qualified education expenses. You can also consider creating a Coverdell Education Savings Account or a custodial account under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA).</p>
<p>Ensure that you set clear guidelines and instructions for how the funds should be used and accessed. This can include requirements for maintaining a specific grade point average or pursuing a particular field of study. Doing so will help you set your beneficiaries up for success and leave a lasting legacy for your family.</p>
<h2>What is the best way to pass on an inheritance?</h2>
<p>Each individual may have a unique situation or idea for passing on an inheritance based on their assets, accumulated wealth, debt, family relations, and more. For instance, some may have children or grandchildren to leave their assets to; others may want to support a charity or cause they are passionate about. Irrespective of the situation, it is important to carefully consider how to pass on your inheritance to ensure that your wishes are fulfilled, and your loved ones are taken care of.</p>
<p>Before passing on your inheritance, there are several factors to consider. First, think about the age and financial situation of your beneficiaries. Will they need the funds immediately, or can they wait? Do they have any outstanding debts or financial obligations that need to be considered? Additionally, it is essential to consider any potential tax implications of your decisions. Depending on the size of your estate, your beneficiaries may be subject to inheritance taxes or other fees.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best way to pass on your inheritance depends on your specific situation and priorities. Consult with a financial advisor who can create a plan that meets your needs and ensures that your legacy lives on.</p>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>Ensuring a smooth transfer of assets as inheritance is critical to ensure control over your legacy, while also providing for your loved ones’ financial well-being and security. By taking proactive steps and seeking the assistance of experienced professionals, individuals can navigate the complexities of inheritance and create a solid foundation for the future. Consider reaching out to a professional who can set up an estate plan for you based on your wishes such as setting up trusts, gifting assets to your heirs, or exploring life insurance as a form of inheritance. You can create an effective, personalized plan aligning with your goals with expert guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people believe that estate planning is for the rich. Others are under the misconception that you do not need comprehensive estate planning if your estate is worth $11.7 million in 2021, which is the federal estate tax exemption limit for 2021. However, every adult, and every family, needs an estate plan. Attending this essential task is a healthy step in your financial planning process. Also, a failproof <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/trust-based-estate-plan/">estate plan</a> ensures that you and your loved ones are secure from an unforeseen financial tragedy. Both estate planning and financial planning are a means to a happy and safe future. Despite its necessity, more than half of the U.S. adults have not organized their estate plans, and even those who have an estate plan have several loopholes, increasing the chances of probate.</p>
<p>According to a survey by Caring.com, the number of people (in the age group 35-54) with a will has gone down from 37% in 2019 to 22.5% in 2021. Only 44% of people above 55 have a will in 2021, which is a reduction of 16% from 2019. The survey also specified that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the estate planning numbers have not improved. Even though people understand the importance of estate planning, they have not taken any productive steps in this direction. One of every three participants said COVID-19 made them realize the importance of estate planning, but 31% of these people did not undertake any estate planning measures.</p>
<p>To ensure your financial and estate planning is failsafe, <strong>it is advisable to <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=financial_advisors_for_estate_planning&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consult a financial advisor</a> who can offer expert guidance in financial planning matters.</strong> Financial advisors have expertise in managing estate plans, ensuring your and your family’s financial future is secure and that your assets are optimally distributed per your wishes. Working with a financial advisor on financial and estate planning matters minimizes planning mistakes, which can otherwise be a common occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some estate planning mistakes you can easily avoid by working with a financial advisor:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taking wrong inventory of your assets: </strong>The first step in any financial and estate planning process is to take inventory of your assets. To ensure your assets are designated to the right person in case of your death or incapacitation, it is important to take note of assets (tangible and intangible). The tangible assets may include homes, real estate properties, vehicles, collectibles, and other personal possessions. Alternatively, intangible assets will comprise all your retirement saving accounts (401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account, etc.), stock market investments (stocks, bonds, and mutual funds), life insurance policies, bank accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), fixed deposits, health savings account (HSA), business stakes, and more. Your financial advisor can work with you to ensure all your assets are counted in their realistic value, considering vital aspects like depreciation, penalties, withdrawal taxes, etc. The advisor will use external reports like a recent home appraisal, bank account statements, etc., to quantify the total value of your assets. This can be a complicated process, and you could likely make significant errors without the support of an experienced financial advisor. Financial advisors will use their expertise to ensure a fair accounting and distribution of your assets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignoring your financial needs: </strong>Most people make the mistake of thinking that estate planning is helpful only after their demise. However, a holistic estate plan is critical even when you are alive. It is a means to an end. Estate planning is crucial to make sure your assets are passed on effectively to your heirs and you are financially secure in case of physical or mental incapacitation.<strong> </strong>You cannot control the events in your life, but you can be prepared to face the worst situations with a well-drafted estate plan that primarily accounts for your needs and then aims at a fair asset distribution.<strong> </strong>Your financial advisor will place your needs as a priority, and create an estate plan that financially secures you against future adversities, such as disability, mental incapacitation, etc. Your advisor will ensure that you retain control over your assets in the present and even guide asset distribution after your demise. In addition, they will compile your legal documents and work with you to list your estate directives. The expert will also help you create a living trust to place your assets and receive benefits during your lifetime. You can later transfer them as per your directions to the designated beneficiaries after your demise. The advisor can also help you select a trustee or create a power of attorney for the individual who will take over the trust, and be responsible for making financial and legal decisions on your behalf in case of your incapacitation or death. Establishing a trust can also help avoid probate, which is a must in general estate-related matters. Most often, people forget to lay down their medical instructions. A financial advisor takes care of all such loopholes and ensures your needs are met. You can have a separate power of attorney or leave a healthcare proxy or a living will regarding medical care instructions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not designating the right beneficiaries: </strong>One of the prime reasons estate planning is so pivotal is because it assures adequate and desirable estate passing and division. However, most often, this is an erroneous area in the estate planning process. Most people list different beneficiaries in their will and retirement accounts, which often creates a legal issue. For instance, you could still have your ex-spouse as your <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/financial-advisor-guide/things-to-know-about-ira-beneficiary-designation/">IRA beneficiary</a>, but the will lists your current spouse as the beneficiary. Moreover, not clearly specifying the beneficiary names or not mentioning the precise share of each beneficiary can also cause family feuds. However, a financial advisor ensures such mistakes are rectified, and your estate plan is the final word on matters related to your estate and assets. Your advisor will help you review your various retirement accounts and insurance plans and assess their beneficiaries. In case you want to change the nominees, your advisor will guide you through the process. The ultimate objective is to align your estate beneficiaries with your desires and avoid family or legal disputes. If your beneficiaries on the will are different from the retirement or insurance account nominations, the latter will receive preference over the former. This could defeat the purpose of the entire estate plan. That said, apart from reviewing and updating your beneficiaries, your financial advisor will help you avoid simple mistakes like mentioning incorrect or incomplete beneficiary names, not explicitly specifying the actual beneficiary estate share, and more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overlooking your family’s financial needs: </strong>An estate plan that does not adequately account for your family’s needs is not complete. This is even more critical if you have minor children or a child that requires special attention. Your financial advisor can make an estate plan that takes care of your children and other family members. This includes naming a caretaker or guardian who will be responsible for your children after your demise. Your advisor can help you explicitly document your wishes regarding the care and future of your children. If you have a minor child or a special needs child, you can assign someone to handle the financial affairs on their behalf. Your advisor can also guide you regarding creating a trust, limiting the power of the guardian/caretaker, listing advance medical directives, specifying the most desirable use of assets, as well as be the final decision maker in case of disagreement between the child and legal guardian, and more. You can also set aside a specific share of your estate for the legal guardian and mention their right against the estate.</li>

<strong>Failure to educate and communicate with your family on your future financial plans:  </strong></p>
<p>Talking about your estate plan with your family and loved ones can be an emotional and difficult conversation. However, having this conversation is vital for not only you but also their financial security. Failure to educate and communicate the estate plan to the family is one of the prime reasons for its failures. Educating the next generation about the estate and succession plans will help them minimize wastage or mismanagement of assets. Moreover, communicating your estate needs and goals can minimize future complications and family disputes. Work with your financial advisor to teach your children or potential beneficiaries how to manage your estate. <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=financial_advisors_for_estate_planning&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>You can consult your financial advisor </strong></a>to create a plan on teaching the younger generation about the importance of estate planning, building financial literacy, accustoming them to the estate assets, making them understand estate taxes, and more. Further, communicate with your family about your estate assets, retirement accounts, insurance plans, medical directives, and more. If you have any pending financial liabilities or debts to pay off, the future generation should be made aware of the brunt. You could choose to talk to your children yourself or ask your financial advisor to handle the conversation in detail. Open and honest communication and education regarding your estate plan and desires will potentially lower the risk of family disputes, helping to preserve the estate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drafting an improper will: </strong>A will is one of the most vital estate documents. As per financial experts, everyone above 18 should have a will that clearly states their wishes and distribution of assets. An estate plan without a comprehensive will is incomplete. If you fail to draft a complete and clear will, there is a high chance a family feud may arise even between the closest of family members concerning the distribution of estate assets. Moreover, if you die without creating a will, your estate will be subject to probate, and the court will decide the distribution of your estate assets. The process of probate involves extensive paperwork at high costs and is significantly time-consuming. Also, the proceedings can go on for years, causing a lot of trouble for your family. The court could also allow the creditors to make the first claim on your assets, which could reduce the estate share of your heirs. Hence, it is best to consult your financial advisor and create a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/estate-planning/soup-to-nuts-guide-to-creating-a-foolproof-will/">foolproof will</a> as a part of your estate plan. The advisor will help you take proper inventory of your assets, complete all required formalities, file necessary paperwork, and more. The financial advisor can also offer advice regarding the distribution of your estate among beneficiaries, the appointment of guardians and trustees, etc. The advisor will also ask you to nominate an executor who would ensure the safekeeping of your will, its execution and see to it that it is read in the future in your absence. You can choose your bank, attorney, family member, or friend as the executor of your will. Remember to sign and date your will in front of two witnesses. It is also important to draft your will in the best of health and a sound mind.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing estate taxes: </strong>One of the most common mistakes that a lot of people make in estate planning and financial planning is ignoring their taxes or not precisely accounting for them. If done well, financial planning and estate planning can reduce tax liabilities for you and your heirs. While efficient financial planning will help you minimize your tax burden when you are alive, competent estate planning can assure your heirs pay a minimum sum towards estate taxes and duties on their inheritance. For<strong> </strong>2021, estates worth up to Rs. $11.7 million are exempt from federal taxes. Even though some states levy taxes on lower estate values, it is possible to minimize the overall estate tax burden by working with a financial advisor. The financial advisor will use estate planning strategies to lower your tax liability. Some of these strategies include<strong> </strong>creating a joint trust for married couples to lower estate taxes (also known as A-B trust), sponsoring the education of your children or grandchildren, offering lifetime gifts, donating to registered tax-advantaged charitable organizations, making conditional wealth transfers to custodians of minor children, creating an irrevocable trust, and more. Your advisor can also suggest investing in private annuities or locking the present value of your estate to reduce the future taxes for your beneficiaries. In the estate freezing method, you can freeze the current value of your estate and the corresponding tax liability. The estate freezing strategy helps you know your estate taxes in advance and pay the income tax accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failure to revisit your estate plan: </strong>Life changes, and so should your estate plan. A sound estate plan should ideally align with your current wishes at all times. However, most people forget to update their estate plans with advances in their life stages. A financial advisor will offer much-needed guidance in this sphere. The advisor will help you update or recreate your estate plan in case of significant life-altering events, such as marriage, divorce, children, grandchildren, retirement, disability, old age, loss of a loved one, etc. You can also revisit your estate plan even when your life stages do not change, but your estate wishes differ from before. The objective is to ensure that your estate plan is allied with your preferences. Your financial advisor can create a disciplined review process where you revisit your estate plan at predefined intervals.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>To conclude</strong></h2>
<p>Financial and estate planning are intricate and complex processes where you could make several mistakes without proper guidance. A fallible estate plan can be a landmine for tax and legal consequences. It can also hamper the distribution of assets per your desires. Moreover, since the estate laws and rules are complicated and ever-changing, it is beneficial to consult a professional financial advisor to help you create an infallible estate plan. A well-drafted, all-inclusive estate plan assures your financial safety when you are alive and acts as a reliable financial shield for your family after your demise. If you are in the process of planning for a secure and comfortable financial future – as every adult ideally should, do not hesitate to reach out to a professional financial advisor. A wise step today can financially protect you and your family for a lifetime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to planning for the future, both retirement planning and estate planning are equally important. While the former will ensure that you have enough money to last your non-working years, the latter will ensure that your money goes to its rightful inheritors. Retirement accounts like an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), a 401(k) retirement account, Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), etc., are common choices for most people. These accounts can offer tax benefits along with decent growth on your money. They have some strict rules, and you must adhere to the contribution limits, withdrawals limits, and other criteria to avoid penalties. But all in all, they are quite handy for risk-free savings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your retirement accounts are like your lifelines in retirement. They keep you financially secure and independent when you are old and unable to work to earn a living. Therefore, it is important to understand how each of these retirement accounts work before you invest, so you can fully benefit from them, a task <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=estate_planning_for_persons_with_large_retirement_accounts&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a professional financial advisor</a> can help you with. Your retirement account savings can also help your spouse, children, or grandchildren in the form of inheritance, especially if you have a large retirement fund. Hence, understanding the effects of 401k inheritance tax or IRA estate tax is equally necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This article talks about everything there is to know about retirement accounts and estate planning. Read on to know more.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Are retirement accounts taxed after death?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, retirement accounts are taxed after death when passed on to your legal heirs. There are different taxes that the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) may levy on your accounts. The burden of paying these taxes falls on the shoulders of the inheritor, such as a spouse, child, or grandchild. Taxes are levied on retirement accounts as well as on any other assets, such as real estate, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, life insurance plans, etc. that you may have inherited. Here are some taxes that may be levied on your assets:</p>

<h3><strong>Income tax: </strong></h3>
Retirement accounts are subject to state and federal income tax. However, in the unfortunate event of death, before your heirs inherit any of your assets, they will go through a step-up basis. As per this, the capital gains earned on your assets from the day they were purchased to the day they were inherited are removed, thereby reducing the tax liability of the inheritor. But if you own a large retirement fund, the taxes charged could still be high even after removing the capital gains.
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to understand how your retirement accounts are taxed when your heirs withdraw money from them. All retirement accounts except Roth IRAs can be taxed after the death of the primary account owner. Roth IRAs cannot be taxed on withdrawal by your heirs as you have already paid tax on your contributions. However, in the case of a traditional 401(k) or IRA, when your heirs make a withdrawal, the money is no longer treated as tax deferred funds. Therefore, the withdrawals are added to the heir’s taxable income and taxed as per the tax slab they fall into.</p>

<h3><strong>Estate tax: </strong></h3>
There are two types of estate taxes that are levied &#8211; one at the state level and the other at the federal level. When your heirs inherit your assets, they have to pay taxes on them, depending on the value of your asset. As of 2021, for an individual, assets up to $11.7 million can be passed on to their heirs without incurring any federal tax. For married couples, assets up to $23.4 million can be passed on to the heirs without attracting any federal estate tax. While these figures may seem high and may not impact most retirees, they can have severe repercussions on people with a large estate and high retirement account savings.

State taxes, on the other hand, can differ for each state. Not all states levy a state tax, so you should check the rules of your state before you decide to settle there after retirement. The state you pick can significantly alter your estate. For instance, Hawaii and Washington have the highest estate tax of 20%. These taxes are paid from the estate and then passed on to your heirs. So, the higher the tax, the lower is the amount inherited.
<h3><strong>GST tax: </strong></h3>
A lot of people leave their retirement accounts for their grandchildren instead of their children. While leaving your estate behind for your grandchildren can help them in several ways, it can also result in a huge tax liability because of the Generation Skipping Transfer tax. The GST tax is a federal tax that is levied in case of an inheritance transfer if the inheritor is at least 37.5 years younger than the original owner. This happens when you skip a generation and pass on your assets to your grandchildren directly instead of your children. This tax was introduced in 1976. Before the tax was established, people could transfer their assets to their grandchildren without incurring any tax liabilities. However, with the introduction of the tax, you now have to pay a flat GST tax of 40% when passing on your estate to your grandchildren. GST may result in the same tax liabilities for your grandchildren as inheritance tax for your children. As of 2021, the GST tax exemption limit is the same as the federal estate tax limit of $11.7 million for an individual and $23.4 million for a married couple.

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Some important things to know about RMDs of large retirement accounts after inheritance </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">RMDs or required minimum distributions are mandatory withdrawals that an account owner or inheritor has to make after a certain age. Earlier, non-spousal and spousal inheritors could choose not to make distributions and let the money grow tax deferred in the retirement accounts. However, the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act removed this provision for non-spousal beneficiaries. Starting from 2020, all non-spousal beneficiaries like children, grandchildren, etc., have to take RMDs. According to the new Act, beneficiaries other than the spouse need to withdraw the entire value of the retirement account within 10 years of inheriting the account. If the retirement account still holds any money after the 10 year period is over, the IRS will levy a 50% penalty tax on the account.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">401(k) and IRA estate tax planning are very important, especially if you want to pass on your retirement accounts to your children. As a non-spousal inheritor, your heirs can severely lose out on money due to heavy taxes. For instance, if your child inherits an IRA with a value of $1,000,000, they would have to withdraw this entire amount in 10 years. This can amount to a taxable income of $100,000 every year from the retirement account alone. Coupled with your child’s annual income, this could place them in a high tax bracket.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Useful ways to reduce the costs incurred by your inheritors</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are some ways that can help you reduce the costs incurred by your legal heirs, such as the ones mentioned below:</p>

<h3><strong>Name a beneficiary and avoid probate</strong>:</h3>
Probate can cost your family members years of legal battles and hefty fees paid to lawyers. Not only may it cause financial loss but it may also disrupt their peace of mind and lead to family feuds. One of the simplest ways to avoid all this chaos is to name a beneficiary on your retirement accounts. All retirement accounts have the option to name a beneficiary who could be a spouse, a child, a grandchild, etc. In the unfortunate event of your death, the person named as your beneficiary gets the ownership of your account and not the person named in your will. Hence, make sure to make a sound decision and name a beneficiary after careful evaluation. This will eliminate the need for a probate and save your loved ones thousands of dollars. You should also remember to update the names of the beneficiaries whenever a major life changing event takes place. For instance, if you get divorced or remarried, you may want to put your current spouse’s name on your retirement account and remove the ex-spouse’s name. Similarly, if you lose your spouse, you may want to add a child’s name instead. It is important to always update your accounts and match the information with the one on your will.Another thing to keep in mind while naming the beneficiary is to discuss it with the person in question. As appealing as the thought of inheriting a large retirement account may seem, it can also incur heavy income tax. In some cases, it may be better to pass on the retirement account to your spouse as spousal inheritances still reserve the right to stretch the withdrawals as per the IRS life expectancy table for RMDs. But, a non-spousal inheritor will have to withdraw the remaining balance within 10 years at all costs.
<h3><strong>Give gifts to your children and grandchildren: </strong></h3>
Passing on your retirement accounts can trigger heavy taxes for your children and grandchildren. The GST tax is charged at a flat 40%, which can take a large chunk out of your overall savings. Even children can be subject to high income tax depending on the tax slab they fall into. As a way out, you can divert your other assets towards your children. As of 2021, you can give gifts of up to $15,000 in a year without incurring any federal gift tax. The lifetime gift limit is $11.7 million in 2021 for an individual. So, you can give your children some of your assets in gifts and avoid any tax liabilities. You can use the funds from your retirement accounts to purchase other assets for your children instead of passing on the account directly.
<h3><strong>Be careful when you select a state to retire: </strong></h3>
States like Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Minnesota, and Washington charge state tax on inheritance. Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington charge only an estate tax. Iowa, Nebraska, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky charge only an inheritance tax. Maryland is the only state that charges both inheritance and estate tax.A lot of factors can determine where you settle after retirement, and taxes may not always make it to the top of the list. But it is still advisable to consider them. State taxes can amount to a lot of money, especially in the case of large estates. So, choose wisely.
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>To conclude</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Retirement accounts and estate planning need to go hand in hand. You should keep in mind to always update the beneficiary names as per your current relationship status and family needs. Large retirement accounts can result in high taxes, but there are some ways to reduce the overall output. So, plan in advance and discuss your options with a professional <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=estate_planning_for_persons_with_large_retirement_accounts&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advisor</a> before you put an estate plan in place. <strong>
