					<p>While many of our clients come to us when they're nearing retirement or are already retired, we believe that it's never too early (or too late) to start thinking about your financial future.  At Focus Wealth Strategies, we don't believe that anyone should be left out when it comes to getting good advice. That's why we do not have account minimums and have built up a team of advisors with expertise in a variety of areas from investments to insurance, tax planning to military benefits, and everything in between.  Our clients appreciate being able to come to us for all their financial needs, and they especially value the incorporation of financial planning with a practicing CPA.</p>

					<p>For over two decades, Jorge has had the privilege of helping business owners, executives, and physicians turn their ambitions into achievable financial goals. His career began in 2002 at the largest financial planning company in the world. After nine years of managing hundreds of client relationships and mentoring dozens of advisors, Jorge realized his true passion was working one-on-one with clients to make a real difference in their lives.  In 2010, Jorge took a leap of faith and founded Success Wealth Management, a boutique Wealth Management and Financial Planning Services firm in Tampa, FL, to offer a highly personalized financial planning service to a select number of clients. As a Certified Financial Planner<sup>&trade;</sup> (CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>), he is proud to have grown his practice primarily through referrals and by serving as a trusted Dave Ramsey SmartVestor Pro across three markets since 2017.  Outside of work, Jorge is a proud nerd with a Bachelor of Science degree in Financial Planning, graduating summa cum laude. At 16, he became Venezuela's National Chess Champion and ranked 36th in the world at the World Youth Chess Championship in Bratislava, Slovakia. However, Jorge considers his greatest accomplishment to be his family: his wife, Amanda, and their three daughters, who inspire him every day to be the best person he can be.</p>

					<p>I graduated from Hampden-Sydney College with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 1999. Driven by a lifelong ambition to work on Wall Street, I moved to New York City in December 2000 and began my career on a trading desk at Bear Stearns. Over the next decade, I honed my skills in trading equity and fixed income securities, gaining invaluable experience in the fast-paced world of finance.  In 2012, I relocated to Tampa, Florida, where I transitioned into a role as a financial advisor with 21st Century Financial. My passion for providing personalized financial guidance led me to become an independent advisor and eventually establish my own company. This move allowed me to broaden my reach and better serve the best interests of my clients.  With a deep commitment to helping individuals and families achieve their financial goals, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to every client relationship. My extensive background in trading and financial advising, combined with my dedication to client success, makes me a trusted partner in navigating the complexities of financial planning.</p>

					<p>Vivienne has been providing financial advice to clients throughout the U.S since 1995. Vivienne's passion for assisting others in making healthy financial decisions and plans for the future comes from her personal experience assisting her family with litigation and financial issues following the passing of her father in 1984, the founder of the family's business. In 2008, she joined LPL Financial and founded her firm, Alpina Financial Consultants, bringing her practice with her. She continued to build a client base from her dedication to understanding clients' specific needs and preparing investment and savings plans that were customized to address those needs. In 2015, she founded her own fiduciary advisory firm together with her husband, Gary Mathews. For nearly 30 years, Vivienne has helped guide countless clients with strategies to build and preserve their wealth. Her financial planning strategy is rooted in a client specific investment philosophy combined with a tax minimization plan, and insurance-protected portfolio of assets. Her focus is helping small business owners and people from all walks of life, protect their income and plan for retirement. Vivienne's philosophy is: A customer is someone you sell something to. A Client is someone you protect.</p>

					<p>Born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Jacob built a career rooted in service and leadership. He spent 20 years in the U.S. military, first as an F/A-18 aircraft mechanic in the Marine Corps before transitioning to the Army to work on Blackhawks, Chinooks, Apache's, and Kiowas. His final decade was spent in Civil Affairs under special operations, honing his expertise in strategy and global operations. After retiring in 2020, Jacob shifted his focus to financial services, bringing the same discipline, adaptability, and mission-oriented mindset that defined his military career. He earned an MBA from Louisiana State University and joined Independent Financial Partners (IFP) as a project manager. Through a commitment to operational excellence, he quickly obtained his Series 7, 24, and 66 licenses and rose to Director of Operations, where he oversaw six key departments, ensuring efficiency, compliance, and advisor support. In 2025, Jacob founded SITREP Financial, dedicated to guiding individuals and businesses through financial complexities with clarity and confidence. With a focus on integrity, strategic planning, and client-first service, SITREP Financial helps clients navigate investments, retirement planning, and financial decision-making with the same precision and dedication that Jacob brought to his military and leadership roles.</p>

					<p>Camarda's advisory team is led by Dr. Jeff Camarda. Jeff has both a PhD and Master's in Financial Planning, has another Master's in Tax Law from Georgetown Law, and has completed the CFA<sup>&reg;</sup>, CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>, ChFC<sup>&reg;</sup>, BCM<sup>&trade;</sup>, CFS<sup>&reg;</sup> and other programs. The CFA<sup>&reg;</sup> is widely regarded as the premier portfolio management designation. Jeff is also an admitted IRS Practitioner authorized to represent clients in tax law matters before IRS.   Camarda is a strictly fee-only, fiduciary investment and wealth management firm. No commissions are accepted for any work whatsoever. Avoiding conflicts of interest and expertly representing clients' interests first and foremost is our highest priority. We call that Wealth Done Right<sup>&reg;</sup>, and feel so strongly about it we trademarked it with the US Patent Office. We serve clients across the US.  Under Jeff's leadership, Camarda has evolved into a rare "Total Wealth Care" firm, offering ongoing advice on investments, estate and trust planning, asset protection, retirement income planning, tax reduction strategy, financial planning, insurance and risk management, even real estate and business consulting - all on a strictly fee -only/no commission basis, and all included in our competitive investment management fee. Coordinated tax preparation and legal (including trusts, estate and asset protection documents, and more) is available via TaxMaster, Camarda's wholly owned affiliate. Camarda truly is a one-stop shop for all wealth matters. Our goal is to make it very easy and cost effective to get very sophisticated, ongoing "one point of contact" advice.   Camarda also offer highly customized portfolio management, unlike the "five sizes fit all" cookie cutter programs that have become very common in the advisory world. Camarda is also an extremely proactive portfolio manager, watching the markets regularly, and standing ready to make moves designed to not only grow wealth but protect it from the devastation of market crashes. We think you will find Camarda's a very rare and valuable advisory skillset.  Jeff's career has been driven by a single mission: an unrelenting study of advanced wealth techniques designed to provide clients with sophisticated financial strategies that go far beyond traditional investment management. As CEO & Chief Wealth Officer of Camarda Wealth, Jeff's propriety systems and hand-trained advisory team provides clients with comprehensive, research-driven wealth counsel designed to optimize returns, protect investments,  reduce tax burdens, and maximize intergenerational family wealth. With a lifelong passion for financial education, Jeff has earned some of the industry's most prestigious designations, as well as three post-graduate degrees in wealth management including his PhD in Financial & Retirement Planning.  He's also an industry-leading academic researcher specializing in advisor education and ethics. He's been a published author for decades, including writing a column on advanced wealth for Forbes. His most recent book, Financial Storm Warning for Investors,  was an Amazon bestseller. He's been repeatedly featured and interviewed in the national financial press, including Barron's, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and more.</p>

					<p>5 key things set Camarda apart:  1. Real Fiduciary
Camarda is a dedicated fiduciary advisor, legally bound to put your interests first. We accept no compensation besides fully disclosed fees. Clients only pay for work they ask us to do.
That's not true for something like 90% of advisors who are either straight commission, or worse, have both fiduciary and commission licenses. Such advisors may gain your trust as fiduciaries, but perhaps later switch hats, and charge you expensive but hard-to-spot commissions.   We take fiduciary responsibility seriously. Our duty is to protect your best interests.  2. Credentialed & Experienced Advisory Team
Finding any licensed investment advisor is easy hundreds of thousands have securities licenses. We think such licenses are too easy to get. No college, experience, or financial background is required. Smart wealth is complicated stuff. There's a lot on the line, including your quality of life, retirement, and family legacy. Getting it right is critically important. Camarda has PhDs on the team, as well as many advanced credentials, including IRS-admitted tax practitioners, and CFA<sup>&reg;</sup>s.  Approximately 2% of advisors have the CFA<sup>&reg;</sup>. But if you want investment advice, don't you want a team with recognized expertise?  3. "Total Wealth Care"
Finding a CFA<sup>&reg;</sup>-grade fiduciary advisor is hard enough. Finding a team expert in the other things you probably care about like tax reduction strategy, estate planning and trust design, asset protection, real estate, insurance, and business planning, is even harder to find. Luckily, you found us! The Camarda Group is experienced and knowledgeable in all these areas, and more. One quarterback, one team, one systematized, completely integrated wealth management process.  You may have struggled in the past with finding a depth and bandwidth of expertise, but not here.  4. Proactive Portfolio Management
Many advisors are religiously buy-and-hold or have similar passive strategies that make no effort to get out of the way of major market meltdowns. But if you're hit with a bear market in or near retirement, wealth can be erased forever&
We think that can be a big mistake.  While the market's long-term trend is generally up, sometimes severe plunges occur which can be devastating especially in or near retirement. A frequent investor complaint after such plunges is "my advisor did nothing to protect me." In contrast, we are extremely proactive managers. We watch the markets closely on an ongoing basis. We stand ready to make the moves we feel necessary to both optimize results and avoid losses.  5. Consistent National Recognition
With decades of experience, Camarda is proud to have been repeatedly nationally featured*, including in The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, Forbes, Bloomberg, Investopedia, and more. 
*(Camarda did not pay for these recognitions. Barron's, a Dow Jones Company, most recently recognized Camarda 3/14/20 based on data through 9/30/19. Forbes most recently recognized Camarda on 4/3/24, based on SHOOK Research, LLC data as of 6/30/23. Please see https://camarda.com/faq)</p>

He focuses on financial planning and wealth management for individuals and families.  Daniel is committed to an independent and personalized approach to helping his clients. He believes the best way to do this is through a holistic financial planning process that considers every aspect of a client's financial life. The first step in this process is to fully understand his client's specific financial goals and objectives. Once those are determined he works with them to develop an appropriate strategy that includes asset allocation, investment selection, risk management, income planning, budgeting and insurance analysis. After the strategy is implemented Daniel will conduct regular reviews for his clients to help ensure that the plan is monitored and kept on target with their goals.</p>

					<p>Nathan Helms grew up in Winter Haven, FL, and began investing when he was just twelve years old with his fathers broker. This early interest in investing led him to a B.A. in Finance from the University of Florida, where he lettered in baseball. Before joining Accurate Advisory Group, he was a financial advisor with both ING Financial Partners, Ameriprise, and LPL Financial. Nathan's wife Julie works in the energy industry.  Nathan's father is a retired judge, his mother a retired teacher, his brother a firefighter, and his sister is a senior marketing vice president for a healthcare company. The family shares the belief that being of service to others is of utmost importance. This overarching value and his love of investing led Nathan to a career in financial services.  Outside of work, Nathan enjoys spending time with friends and family, traveling, reading, and cheering on the Florida Gators.</p>
