					<description><![CDATA[Instead of asking financial advisors, &#039;Am I beating what is normal?&#039; a client should ask, &#039;Did I achieve a good risk-adjusted return for my personal situation and goals?&#039; This is a more insightful approach.

To effectively evaluate your financial advisor, always ask questions like:

 - If I lose 10% of my investment in year one and make 10% back in year two, how much have I gained or lost?
 - Can I pay you hourly, and how does that work?
 - If interest rates go up, does the value of a bond fund increase or decrease?
 - Do you have your own money in what you recommend to me? Can you prove that?]]></description>
