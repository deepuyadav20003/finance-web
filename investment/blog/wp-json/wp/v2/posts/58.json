List your assets and liabilities<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You approach a financial advisor with a view to bettering your financial life. For a better financial state, you first need to understand your current financial state. Make a list of all your assets \u2013 cash, gold, investments, property, etc. and quantify them. Also, don\u2019t forget to list down your liabilities. Create your debt profile by making a note of all your debts and prioritising them. A clearer picture of your assets and liabilities will help your advisor craft a suitable plan for you.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Outline_your_income_and_expenses\"><\/span>2. Outline your income and expenses<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>To be able to discuss your finances with your financial advisor, it is imperative to have an idea of all your sources of income and expenses. It is always better to write these down so that you don\u2019t miss adding petty expenses or any small income. Ensure you don\u2019t add expected sources of income. If things don\u2019t go as planned, you might end up facing a money crunch. On the other hand, it is advisable to take expected expenses into consideration. If you expend, you do it from the provision you already made, and if you don\u2019t, you save that money.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Write_down_your_goals\"><\/span>3. Write down your goals<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>By now you understand how much you own and owe. The next step is to make a note of all your goals. It could be as small as buying a phone or as big as buying a plush penthouse. A financial advisor can help you turn your dreams into reality, provided you are clear about them. Before meeting your advisor, ensure you have set specific and well-defined goals. Think of all the possible goal-related questions that your advisor can ask you and prepare for answering them so they can set up the right financial plan for you and track them.<\/p>\n<p>[Recommended Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/financial-advisor-guide\/how-do-financial-advisors-track-and-monitor-your-financial-goals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/financial-advisor-guide\/how-do-financial-advisors-track-and-monitor-your-financial-goals\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1702454406002000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18SFX34pgBnyhuXS5bwF0z\">How Do Financial Advisors Track and Monitor Your Financial Goals<\/a>]<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Consider_the_needs_of_your_family\"><\/span>4.

Understand your financial strengths and weaknesses<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your meeting with your financial advisor can turn out to be productive only if you apprise them of your financial state. While having an account of your assets, liabilities, income, and expenses is good, you must also be well aware of your financial strengths and weaknesses. Your advisor can then focus on leveraging your strengths and tackling your weaknesses rather than detecting them. Financial strengths can include the ability to save regularly, the dedication to stick to your personal finance budget, etc. Habits such as irrational spending, digging into savings for every little thing, etc. can be termed as financial weaknesses.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Get_your_financial_documents_in_order\"><\/span>6. Get your financial documents in order<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may not remember everything about your finances accurately. Thus, it is important that you have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/financial-advisor-guide\/what-are-the-financial-documents-required-while-meeting-your-financial-advisor\/\">all your financial documents<\/a> at one place before meeting your financial advisor. These include the latest statements for 401(k), 529 savings plan, etc.; information about your investments; documents related to estate planning namely, your will, life insurance, etc.; your tax records and so on.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Prepare_a_list_of_questions_to_ask_your_advisor\"><\/span>7. Prepare a list of questions to ask your advisor<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Last but definitely not least, give words to your doubts and queries and write them down. Better yet, you can email the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/financial-advisor-guide\/questions-to-ask-your-financial-advisor\/\">list of questions<\/a> to your advisor before your meeting with them. This way, you are far more prepared and structured, which, in turn, becomes a good start. The questions need not just be about your finances; you can even ask them about the services they will be offering to you, about the payments and other terms of engagement, about the future course of action, etc.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"To_Conclude\"><\/span>To Conclude<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Much like doctors, financial advisors can help you be at ease, provided you convey your problems to them without any ambiguity.
