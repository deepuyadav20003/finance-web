The information we gather is used to provide you with an excellent experience in finding, hiring, and referring a local service provider; additionally, it helps us improve our service for your future use. This document describes Wiseradvisor.com&#8217;s privacy policy and practices. This privacy statement applies to www.wiseradvisor.com. Please note that you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy by visiting and using any one of the Wiseradvisor Network of Sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading fw-5 text-heading mt-6 mb-0\">Our Commitment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiseradvisor.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our buyers and businesses. Since we collect certain types of information at the time our service is used, we have created this policy to let our users know what information we collect, how the collected information is used to benefit our users, and how we protect the information that is provided to us. Rest assured, the privacy of our buyers and businesses is of the utmost importance to us, and Wiseradvisor.com will make every commercially reasonable effort to ensure that our users are effectively informed and protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading fw-5 text-heading mt-6 mb-0\">Buyer Protection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to submit a service request to our community of local businesses, buyers are required to provide us with certain information, including but not limited to: email address, phone number, and occasionally a street address where the request will be serviced. The email address allows us to deliver business responses to the buyer online. Buyers&#8217; email addresses are not disclosed to unrelated third party service providers without consent. Note: Businesses may not contact the buyer for any reason other than to address the information or assistance specifically requested in the buyer request as defined in our terms of use to which each business owner is accountable as a member of our service. Buyers can update or modify the contact information they provide to us by logging into their account. By voluntarily providing us with information about yourself, you are consenting to our use of the data that you provide and the data that we collect on our websites and online services in accordance with this policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to providing limited information provided by buyers to businesses as described above, Wiseradvisor.com protects the contact information you provide to us internally. Only authorized employees and subcontractors will have access to the information provided to us in requests. If buyers use our service through one of Wiseradvisor&#8217;s partner sites, we will share the request information submitted through that site with our partners as necessary to fulfill requests. We suggest that you refer to our partner&#8217;s sites for details of their privacy policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiseradvisor.com also offers buyers the opportunity to request news, special offer information, and\/or information about promotions. These opportunities are completely optional, and buyers are not obligated to take advantage of them. Should you change your mind about receiving these secondary messages, you may opt-out at any time by selecting the &#8220;unsubscribe&#8221; function present in every such email we send out. Wiseradvisor is a CAN-SPAM ACT compliant company. We reserve the right to send users service and notification emails without the opportunity to opt out as these are part and parcel of the services provided.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading fw-5 text-heading mt-6 mb-0\">Publicly Displayed Information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wiseradvisor.com reserves the right to post on its Web site the text in the &#8220;Comments&#8221; box and additional product or service information inputted by buyers in the request form. However, we will not post any information included in a buyer request that includes any personally identifiable information. Buyers have the option to cancel requests at any time. When buyers elect to write business reviews on the site, we publish the review but do not publish your email address. Consequently, the above information is publicly available to other users of the sites, as well as the general public. We are not responsible for the personal information published within a review or comments box and encourage users to employ discretion when posting information in public forums. Buyers names and location are typically displayed with their reviews and with Comments box information requests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading fw-5 text-heading mt-6 mb-0\">Business Information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To become a registered business with Wiseradvisor.com, interested parties must provide us with contact information. Contact information submitted for account administration purposes is considered strictly confidential, will not be shared with buyers without consent, and will be used for billing purposes and to provide updates about the Wiseradvisor.com service. Contact information submitted for the Business Profile is intended for buyer viewing and will be shared with buyers as appropriate. This information includes name, email, company address, company name, and phone number. We also collect sensitive financial information such as your credit card number and billing address to establish the service. However, sensitive information, such as financial information is stored on a secured server and is not shared with anyone. Upon registration, a business can set up a public company profile to allow buyers to find them within our directory. Any personal information included within the company profile hosted within our directory is available to the public and may be used to send businesses unsolicited messages. Wiseradvisor.com is not responsible for the personal information hosted in company profiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses may update or revise any account and contact information by logging in to our website and visiting the &#8220;Seller Portfolio&#8221; and &#8220;Billing Information&#8221; sections of our Web site. Businesses may deactivate their account by contacting Customer Support at wa.assistance@wiseradvisor.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact information will be included in the response emails Wiseradvisor.com sends on behalf of businesses. This information is necessary for buyers to contact businesses directly. Businesses select how they wish to be contacted and may opt to be contacted in any or all of the following ways: phone, email, pager\/text, or the business&#8217;s Web site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a business elects to refer the sites to another business, we request the contact name and email address along with company name and phone number to fulfill the request. This information is used to send the one time email as well as track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading fw-5 text-heading mt-6 mb-0\">We use cookies to enhance the Wiseradvisor.com experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cookies are small amounts of data delivered to a user&#8217;s hard drive by a Web browser.

In such an event, we notify users of any significant changes to the information practices governing their collected personal information by posting a notice on the home page or by email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not share, sell, rent or trade Personal Identifying Information (PII) with third parties for their promotional purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading fw-5 text-heading mt-6 mb-0\">Security<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
