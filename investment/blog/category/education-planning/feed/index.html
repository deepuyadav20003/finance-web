										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cost of higher education in the United States has been steadily increasing. This places a significant financial burden on students and their families. In the 2024-25 academic year, the average tuition for full-time in-state students at public four-year institutions rose to $11,610, marking a $300 increase from the previous year, a 2.7% rise before adjusting for inflation. Families need to adopt effective savings strategies to manage these escalating expenses.</p>
<p>Among the most impactful tools for addressing this challenge is the 529 plan. These plans offer a tax-advantaged way to save for education expenses, enabling contributions to grow tax-free and make tax-free withdrawals for qualified expenses. 529 plans help families bridge the gap between rising costs and education funding goals. A <strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=how_529_plans_help_manage_costs_and_maximize_education_savings?pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial advisor</a></strong> can help explain 529 plans and recommend ways to maximize your savings and reduce education costs.</p>
<p>This article explores the key features of 529 plans, their advantages, and practical strategies for using them to manage education costs effectively.</p>
<h2>Understanding 529 plans</h2>
<p>A 529 plan is a specialized savings account created to help families manage the financial demands of education. Designed to encourage education savings, 529 plans offer tax benefits making them a popular choice for families planning for future academic expenses.</p>
<p>Below are the main types of 529 plans, each of which serves a specific purpose:</p>
<h3>1. 529 college savings plans</h3>
<p>Named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 529 plans are tax-deferred savings plans designed to help pay for college expenses. Families can contribute after-tax dollars, which are invested in a preset selection of investment options, usually mutual funds and ETFs. Importantly, any earnings from these investments are not taxed, and withdrawals remain tax-free as long as they are used for qualified educational expenses such as tuition, room and board, books, and supplies.</p>
<h3>2. Prepaid tuition plans</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/education-planning/important-factors-to-consider-while-planning-for-your-childs-college-education/">Prepaid tuition plans</a></strong> allow families to lock in current tuition rates at specific colleges or universities and shield them from future inflation. These plans are ideal for those confident in their choice of institution and location, as they often come with limited flexibility. Many prepaid plans have residency requirements and may restrict their benefits to in-state public colleges or a specific network of schools. Do note that prepaid tuition plans do not cover room and board costs.</p>
<h3>3. Betterment 529 plan</h3>
<p>Families that seek a modern, tech-enabled approach to education savings can use the Betterment 529 plan which provides a simplified and automated investment solution. These plans leverage low-cost investment options and personalized portfolio management to streamline the process of building and managing a 529 college savings plan. It offers a user-friendly platform that helps minimize the complexities often associated with investment planning.</p>
<h2>Benefits of 529 plans</h2>
<p>529 plans offer several benefits, making them a highly effective tool for managing education savings. These advantages extend beyond just financial growth, encompassing tax savings and unparalleled flexibility to accommodate the diverse needs of families and students.</p>
<h3>1. Tax advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal tax-deferred growth</strong>: Earnings within a 529 plan grow on a tax-deferred basis, meaning families are not taxed annually on investment gains. Over time, this allows contributions to accumulate more quickly than taxable accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Tax-free withdrawals</strong>: When funds are withdrawn for qualified educational expenses, such as tuition, room and board, or books, they are not subject to federal income tax. This further amplifies tax savings.</li>
<li><strong>State tax benefits</strong>: Many states offer additional tax incentives for contributing to their 529 plans. Depending on the state, families may be eligible for deductions or credits on state income taxes, providing even more value. However, the availability and extent of these benefits vary, so it’s crucial to understand the specific rules of your state’s 529 program.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Increased flexibility</h3>
<p>529 plans are designed with flexibility in mind. They can accommodate a variety of educational and family scenarios. Funds in a 529 plan can be used for various educational costs, including tuition, room and board, textbooks, and supplies. Additionally, recent changes in regulations allow 529 plan funds to be applied to certain K-12 education expenses and even apprenticeship programs.</p>
<p>Another feature that adds to their utility is the transferability of 529 plans. Suppose the designated beneficiary does not need the funds due to receiving a scholarship or choosing a different path. In that case, the account owner can transfer the funds to another family member without penalty. This flexibility ensures that the savings remain within the family.</p>

<h3>Limitations and considerations of 529 plans</h3>
<p>While 529 plans are highly effective for education savings, it’s essential to understand their limitations and plan accordingly to avoid potential pitfalls.</p>
<h3>1. Penalties for non-qualified withdrawals</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of 529 plans is to fund education. If the funds are withdrawn for non-qualified expenses, the earnings portion of the withdrawal is subject to federal income tax and an additional 10% penalty. These penalties apply, for instance, if funds are used to pay for non-educational personal expenses or transportation that are not considered qualified educational expenses.</p>
<p>There are specific circumstances where the penalty may be waived. If the beneficiary receives a scholarship, the amount equivalent to the scholarship can be withdrawn without the 10% penalty, though the earnings will still be subject to income tax. Other exceptions include the death or disability of the beneficiary, which allows for penalty-free withdrawals.</p>
<h3>2. Impact on financial aid</h3>
<p>Parent-owned 529 plans are treated as parental assets in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) calculation. This means up to 5.64% of the plan’s value may be reduced due to the student’s eligibility for need-based financial aid.</p>
<p>Plans owned by other relatives, such as grandparents, can have a more significant impact. While these accounts are not initially considered in FAFSA calculations, withdrawals are treated as untaxed income for the student in subsequent years, which can reduce financial aid eligibility by as much as 50% of the withdrawal amount.</p>
<h3>3. Overfunding risks</h3>
<p>Overfunding a 529 plan can result in excess funds that may be difficult to use without incurring penalties. If the beneficiary doesn&#8217;t use all the funds for qualified expenses, the remaining balance may attract penalties and taxes when withdrawn.</p>
<p>Unused funds can be transferred to another family member, such as a sibling, without penalty, provided the new beneficiary is a qualified family member. However, careful planning and estimation of education costs can help avoid overfunding from the outset.</p>
<h2>Below are a few key financial strategies for effectively using 529 plans:</h2>
<h3>1. Understand and maximize 529 plan contribution limits</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal gift tax rules and annual limits</strong>: Contributions to a 529 plan are considered gifts for federal tax purposes. In 2025, individuals can contribute up to $19,000 per beneficiary annually without triggering gift taxes up from $18,000 in 2024. The annual gift tax exclusion for married couples is set at $38,000 for 2025, up from $36,000 in 2024.</li>
<li><strong>The “superfunding” strategy</strong>: For high-net-worth individuals, a unique provision allows for “superfunding” a 529 plan. This enables contributors to make up to five years’ worth of gifts in a single year i.e. up to $90,000 for individuals in 2024 or $95,000 in 2025, without incurring gift taxes, provided no additional contributions are made to the same beneficiary during the following four years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Utilize 529 plan catch-up contributions when starting late</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late saving strategies</strong>: For families who start saving later, maximizing annual contributions and leveraging investment options with higher growth potential can help compensate for lost time.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities for relatives</strong>: Grandparents and other relatives often play a critical role in education funding. They can make direct contributions to a 529 plan or use the super funding provision to provide substantial support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Families should prioritize their financial security while planning for education. Using 529 plans in conjunction with retirement accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, can help balance these goals. A 529 plan should be integrated into a comprehensive financial strategy that considers tax implications, expected college costs, and other long-term savings objectives.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Select the right 529 plan for your specific needs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess tax benefits</strong>: Many state-specific plans offer tax deductions or credits for contributions, providing immediate savings. You can opt for a suitable plan among these to save on taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Look at the fees</strong>: Opt for plans with low administrative and investment fees to retain more of your contributions for education expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate investment options</strong>: Look for plans with diverse investment choices that align with your risk tolerance and the time horizon before college expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may compare in-state and out-of-state plans to find the best fit. While state-specific tax benefits are enticing, some out-of-state plans may offer better investment options or lower fees.</p>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>The rising costs of education pose a significant challenge for families. They must, thus, adopt effective savings strategies to ensure value education without compromising on other financial goals. 529 plans provide a structured, tax-advantaged solution to meet these financial demands, enabling families to save and invest specifically for educational expenses.</p>
<p>Consulting a financial advisor can be invaluable in selecting the right plan, maximizing contributions, and taking full advantage of available tax benefits. With thoughtful planning, 529 plans can turn the rising costs of education into a manageable goal and strengthen a family’s ability to build a solid foundation for education savings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 529 plan is a popular investment vehicle designed for individuals, including parents, grandparents, and others, to save for educational expenses. This tax-advantaged account allows for tax-deferred growth and tax-free withdrawals when used for qualified education costs, such as tuition and other related expenses. Sponsored and run by 50 states and the District of Columbia, 529 plans offer a flexible and effective way to plan for future education needs. With new changes in the 529 plan withdrawal rules for 2024, it is essential to understand how these updates could impact your financial strategy.</p>
<p>This article will guide you through the recent changes made to 529 plans and their implications on your retirement planning. Additionally, it can help to consult a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=529_plan_rule_changes_for_2024_and_their_impact_on_your_retirement_planning?pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>financial advisor</strong></a> to understand how these new changes can impact you.</p>
<h2>What are the new 529 plan changes for 2024?</h2>
<p>The 529 plan has seen some significant changes under the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) 2.0 Act, effective in 2024. Earlier, withdrawals from a 529 plan were only tax-free if they were used for qualified education expenses, including tuition, books, supplies, necessary equipment, etc. If there were any remaining funds in the account after paying for qualified expenses and the account holder wanted to use these funds for purposes other than education, they would face federal and state taxes on the earnings portion of the withdrawal. Additionally, a 10% federal penalty would be imposed on the earnings. There were very limited options for making withdrawals without incurring taxes or penalties, typically only in cases of the death or disability of the beneficiary.</p>
<p>However, the SECURE 2.0 Act has introduced a notable change that impacts how you can manage and use your unused 529 plan funds. Under the new 529 plan rules, it is now possible to transfer unused funds from a 529 plan to a Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) without incurring penalties or paying taxes, provided certain conditions are met. This new rule offers more flexibility, allowing account holders to use their remaining 529 plan funds for purposes beyond education, such as <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/retirement-planning/is-saving-10-times-your-annual-income-enough-for-retirement/"><strong>retirement savings</strong></a>. This change can significantly benefit individuals who find themselves with excess funds in their 529 plan and provide a valuable opportunity to enhance their retirement planning strategy.</p>
<h3>Below are updated conditions to transfer the funds from a 529 to the Roth IRA:</h3>
<p><strong>1. The 529 account must have been open for at least 15 years</strong></p>
<p>To be eligible for a rollover, the 529 account must have been open for a minimum of 15 years. Plans that have not reached this 15-year milestone are not eligible for the transfer. Additionally, any contributions or earnings made within the five years preceding the rollover are excluded from the transfer.</p>
<p><strong>2. The beneficiary of the 529 plan should be the owner of the Roth IRA</strong></p>
<p>The individual who is the beneficiary of the 529 plan must also be the owner of the Roth IRA. The transfer is only permissible if the account holder of the Roth IRA is the same person as the beneficiary of the 529 plan. A transfer cannot be made if the Roth IRA belongs to the parent while the 529 plan’s beneficiary is the child.</p>
<p><strong>3. The beneficiary must have a minimum earned income</strong></p>
<p>The beneficiary of the Roth IRA must have a minimum earned income, such as a salary or wage, that is equal to or greater than the amount being transferred in any given year.</p>
<p><strong>4. The lifetime limit for a rollover is capped at $35,000</strong></p>
<p>There is a maximum lifetime limit of $35,000 on the amount that can be rolled over from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA. This limit is imposed on any transfer made from a 529 to a Roth IRA across the lifetime of the individual.</p>
<p><strong>5. The transfers must meet the annual Roth IRA contribution limits</strong></p>
<p>The rollover amount must meet the annual contribution limits set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for Roth IRAs. For 2024, the contribution limit is $7,000 for individuals under 50 and $8,000 for those aged 50 and older. This implies that while the overall limit may be $35,000, you can only transfer up to $7,000 in a year if you are under 50 and up to $8,000 annually if you are over 50 in 2024.</p>
<p>If you meet the above criteria, you can transfer unused 529 plan funds to a Roth IRA. All you need to do is open a Roth IRA account in the beneficiary’s name. In the case of an existing Roth IRA, you can skip this step. Next, you can initiate the transfer by formally requesting the 529 plan provider by submitting the necessary documentation. You can consult a financial advisor for more clarity on the matter or for assistance during the rollover process.</p>

<h2>How do the new 529 plan withdrawal rules impact your retirement planning?</h2>
<p>The new 529 rules under the SECURE Act 2.0 make the withdrawal process more flexible for investors. One of the biggest challenges with traditional 529 plans has been that unused funds would lose their tax advantages, which potentially made them unappealing to account holders. However, the new rule aims to remove this concern by allowing families to use excess funds for retirement. This update makes it easier for investors to repurpose surplus funds for a different financial goal, such as retirement.</p>
<p>Here are some advantages and considerations to help you understand how the new rules affect retirement planning:</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p><strong>1. Offers the option to roll over funds to a Roth IRA</strong></p>
<p>Rolling over funds to a Roth IRA offers several compelling advantages, particularly for retirement savings. A Roth IRA is a tax-advantaged account designed to maximize your retirement benefits. One of its most significant features is that it allows for tax-free withdrawals. This is because you pay taxes on your contributions upfront, so any withdrawals you make in retirement are completely tax-free. This can be a major advantage, as it allows you to manage your tax dues more effectively in the future.</p>
<p>Another key benefit of a Roth IRA is that it does not require Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). Unlike traditional IRAs, which mandate that you begin taking distributions at a certain age, Roth IRAs do not impose such requirements. This means you have complete flexibility over your funds. You can let your money grow undisturbed for as long as you wish and choose the optimal time for withdrawals based on your personal financial situation. This control can help with long-term financial planning and enable you to make strategic decisions about how and when to access your retirement savings.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Roth IRA offers a wide range of investment options that help your money grow and beat inflation. This means that regardless of whether you choose to withdraw your funds or let them remain in the account, your money does not sit idle. Transferring your money to a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/retirement-planning/what-is-a-roth-ira/"><strong>Roth IRA</strong></a> and selecting appropriate investments can enhance the growth potential of your savings and ensure that your funds support your retirement goals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Provides increased flexibility to use the funds</strong></p>
<p>The option to roll over your funds from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA presents significantly better flexibility. The Roth IRA is known for its versatility, as it does not impose restrictions on the usage of funds. The decision on how to utilize the funds rests entirely with the account holder. This means you can allocate the funds for a wide range of expenses, including making home repairs, covering healthcare expenses, traveling, and more in retirement.</p>
<p>In contrast, 529 accounts have stricter guidelines on the usage of funds. They are specifically designed for qualified education expenses, and any deviations from this purpose could result in tax penalties. This limitation can make it challenging to fully use the funds if they are not needed for educational purposes.</p>
<p><strong>3. Removes hesitance around using 529 plans and making overall financial planning more streamlined</strong></p>
<p>Many individuals have been hesitant to use 529 plans due to their lack of flexibility regarding withdrawals. This limitation often deterred investors from taking full advantage of these plans. However, with the new rules introduced under the SECURE Act 2.0, the 529 plan will likely be used by more people.</p>
<p>Previously, there was often an overlap. In a bid to avoid using a 529 plan, parents would use part of their retirement savings to cover their children&#8217;s education costs. This meant dipping into funds intended for retirement and potentially compromising their future financial security.</p>
<p>With the updated rules, this overlap can be potentially reduced. This not only enhances the flexibility of the 529 plan but also offers significant benefits for retirement planning. Families can better prepare for both educational and retirement needs, making the 529 plan a more versatile financial tool.</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>1. Tax implications may differ in different states</strong></p>
<p>Even with the many advantages of the new 529 plan rules, there are important considerations to keep in mind, particularly regarding taxation. The SECURE 2.0 Act is a federal law, which means its provisions apply at the federal level but do not automatically affect state tax regulations. Each state retains the authority to assess and impose its own taxation on 529 plan contributions and withdrawals for its residents.</p>
<p>As a result, the tax treatment of a rollover from a 529 plan into a Roth IRA can vary depending on the state where you file your state income tax. Each state may have its own guidelines and rules regarding how such rollovers are taxed or treated. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how your specific state handles these rollovers to avoid unexpected tax consequences. <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp"><strong>Consulting with a financial advisor</strong></a> in your state can help ensure that you make informed decisions before proceeding with any rollover.</p>
<p><strong>2. Low annual limits for transfers</strong></p>
<p>Although the lifetime limit for transferring funds from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA is set at $35,000, the annual limits are significantly lower based on the Roth IRA contribution limits established by the IRS. For 2024, the annual contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $7,000 for individuals under 50 and $8,000 for those 50 and older. This means that you cannot transfer the entire $35,000 in one lump sum. Instead, the transfer must be spread out over several years to comply with the annual limits. As a result, if you need access to a large amount of funds immediately, you would not be able to achieve this through a rollover under the current rules.</p>
<p><strong>3. The 15-year rule can pose hassles for retirees</strong></p>
<p>The 15-year rule stipulates that a 529 account must be open for at least 15 years before funds can be rolled over to a Roth IRA. Also, the rule requires that the 529 plan beneficiary also own the Roth IRA. Since beneficiaries are often children, this poses a practical challenge for parents. Typically, parents will need to update the beneficiary designation to themselves if they wish to use the funds for their own retirement. However, changing the beneficiary can reset the 15-year rule and complicate the process. This means that if you change the beneficiary’s name, you will have to wait 15 years to make the transfer.</p>
<p>Whether the new SECURE Act 2.0 rules will address this issue is still unclear. If changing the beneficiary does indeed reset the 15-year requirement, it could limit the effectiveness of this strategy for parents, who might have to wait another 15 years before making the transfer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, rolling over funds to a Roth IRA can still present significant benefits. For example, parents can open a Roth IRA for their child. This can provide them with a head start on retirement savings. This early start can be advantageous for the child and offer them long-term benefits with a potentially stronger financial future.</p>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>While the new 529 plan withdrawal rules introduced under the SECURE Act 2.0 offer increased flexibility, it may be too early to determine whether they will be an ideal option for all investors. The ability to roll over funds to a Roth IRA can be beneficial, particularly if your state aligns with these federal rules and offers favorable tax treatment. However, if your state does not comply or imposes different regulations, you might need to reconsider your strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor is advisable to ensure that you make an informed decision regarding your 529 investment and retirement planning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cost of education in America can be burdening. In the last 30 years, the average college cost of a four-year public institution has increased by 213%. In the past decade alone, the cost of education has shot up by 29%, with private college tuition costs rising by 25%. If you have children or grandchildren who want to go to college, there is a good chance you would have thought about how to cover their education expenses. One of the most common ways that people use to save for college fees is a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/education-planning/529-plan-everything-you-need-to-know/">529 savings plan</a>.</p>
<p>529 plans are state-sponsored, tax-advantaged plans that allow you to invest after-tax money into bonds and stocks and then withdraw the money tax-free to pay for qualified education expenses. According to the College Savings Plan Network, as of mid-2019, there were over 14 million 529 college savings accounts with over $352.4 billion in assets. This proves the popularity of the 529 college savings plan among parents planning to send their kids and grandkids to study beyond high school. However, over the years, the popularity of 529 college savings plans has decreased. In March 2020, the balance of the 529 plan dropped down to a $293 billion mark, which is considerably low. One of the reasons for this is the restriction on using the 529 college savings plan for qualified education expenses only. Alternatively, the rise of other tax-saving accounts, like a <span style="color: #999999;"><a style="color: #999999;" href="https://www.rothira.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #66696b;">Roth IRA</span></a></span> (Individual Retirement Account), to cover education costs has further added to the waning of the popularity of the 529 college savings plan.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, a growing proportion of American families has started opting for a Roth IRA for education planning. According to the 2020 Sallie Mae and Ipsos survey, nearly 14% of parents withdrew money from their retirement plans, like a Roth IRA, a 401(k), etc., to pay for college fees and related expenses. In 2015, the number was only 6%. In some cases, parents are increasingly substituting the 529 college savings plan with a Roth IRA because of the freedom and flexibility of use, more investment choices, and several other advantages offered by the latter. However, other parents rely on both – a 529 college savings plan and a Roth IRA – to fund their child’s steeply rising higher education costs.</p>
<p>If you want to consider using Roth IRA for college expenses, you must first understand the different aspects of the account. A<a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp"><u> financial advisor</u></a> can help you understand the benefits afforded by Roth IRA as well as how best to make use of the flexibility offered by the plan when it comes to freedom of use and different investment options.</p>
<p><strong>Here is everything you should know about using a Roth IRA for education:                 </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What is a Roth IRA?</strong></h2>
<p>Introduced in 1997, a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/retirement-planning/whats-so-special-about-a-roth-ira/">Roth IRA</a> is an individual retirement account where you contribute after-tax dollars, and your money grows tax-free. Moreover, you get tax-free withdrawals, provided you have held the Roth IRA account for five years and you are 59.5 years or older. Roth IRAs have been a popular retirement vehicle ever since their launch in 1997. This is because a Roth IRA offers several advantages over the traditional IRA and other retirement savings vehicles. However, in recent years, parents have also started using a Roth IRA to support their child’s education expenses.</p>
<h3><strong>Features of a Roth IRA</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Income eligibility: </strong></strong>You can contribute to a Roth IRA at any age, provided you have earned a taxable income. In addition to this, to be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) should be under $140,000 for 2021 if you are a single tax-filer. However, if you are married and file taxes jointly with your spouse, your MAGI should be lower than $208,000 for 2021.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Contribution limits: </strong></strong>You can contribute to a Roth IRA for yourself and your spouse, provided you file taxes jointly, and either you or your spouse has earned an income. Earned income refers to salary, wages, commission, bonus, freelance jobs, business profits, assignments, etc. The IRS (Internal Revenue Service) alters the contribution limits from time to time. For 2021, you can contribute up to $6,000 in your Roth IRA. However, if you are above the age of 50, you can contribute up to $7,000.<strong> </strong>These limits are maximum ceilings for one or a combination of Roth IRA If you make contributions above the IRS-defined limit, you will incur a penalty of 6% until the error is rectified.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Withdrawal rules</strong></strong>The money in your Roth IRA account grows tax-free until withdrawn. You can take drawings from your Roth IRA at any time. However, if you withdraw money before the age of 59.5 years or before completing five years from the opening of the account, the IRS will levy a penalty of 10% on the sum withdrawn from the account. Moreover, you will also pay tax on the earnings. However, if you use the Roth IRA withdrawals to cover education expenses (postsecondary) or buy a first home, the IRS might waive off the penalty. If you follow the two withdrawal rules, the money you withdraw from your Roth IRA account is considered tax-free. Also, there is no clause for the minimum required distribution in a Roth IRA. Your funds can grow tax-free in your Roth IRA account during your lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Can you use a Roth IRA for college costs?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, you can use a Roth IRA for college expenses as the IRS levies no restriction on the usage of funds from a Roth IRA account. Whereas, even though a 529 college savings plan allows you to invest your after-tax dollars and offers you tax-free growth, you can only use the money from the account to pay for qualified education expenses of the named beneficiary. Qualified education expenses include tuition, room rent, course-related equipment, and books. If you withdraw money from your 529 savings plan and use it for non-qualified expenses, the IRS will charge a 10% penalty on the sum withdrawn. In some cases, like scholarships, the IRS may permit you to use the funds for another purpose.</p>
<p>Further, in a Roth IRA, the IRS allows you to take tax-free withdrawals before the age of 59.5 or without meeting the five-year account criteria if you use the money to cover the higher education costs of your child or grandchild. In this case, you will not pay the 10% penalty and will only be liable to pay the income tax charges as applicable on the earnings portions of your withdrawal amount. However, in this case, if you limit the sum withdrawn from your Roth IRA to just the contributions, your distributions become both – tax and penalty-free – when used for higher education expenses.</p>
<h2><strong>529 Savings Plan compared to using a Roth IRA for college costs: Which is better?</strong></h2>
<p>The 529 college savings plans are an effective way to save for your child’s education costs. These plans are state-sponsored, tax-advantaged plans where you can invest your after-tax dollars for higher education. The growth in this account is tax-deferred. If you begin investing in these plans at an early age, you can comfortably sponsor the education expenses of your child. 529 college savings plans invest your money in different secure bonds and low-cost stocks to generate competitive returns in the long run. But your withdrawals are tax-exempt only if you use the sum for qualified education expenses. However, this mandate does not apply to a Roth IRA withdrawal.</p>
<p>Apart from the withdrawal parameter, here is a detailed categorization of the benefits and drawbacks of using a 529 savings plan compared to using a Roth IRA for college costs:</p>
<h3><strong>Advantages of using a 529 plan for college expenses</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The contributions are made from after-tax dollars, and the money in your account grows tax-free.</li>
<li>You do not pay any tax on withdrawal, provided you use the money for qualified education expenses.</li>
<li>You can get a partial or full tax deduction or credit if you live in a state that offers income tax advantages for using the state 529 college savings plan.</li>
<li>There is no income or age limit for a 529 plan. However, each state sets its contribution limits.</li>
<li>You can avoid the federal gift tax if your annual contribution per beneficiary is below $15,000.</li>
<li>These plans are easy to manage with limited investment options. You can select a specific mode of investment, contribute regularly, and allow your funds to grow over time.</li>
<li>The 529 college savings plans generally offer low-cost investment options due to access to institutional share classes, which typically have a low expense ratio.</li>
<li>The 529 plans do not affect your financial aid. These plans are counted at a 5.64% rate at the time of financial aid eligibility assessment. Moreover, qualified distributions from these accounts are excluded, and hence, they do not appear as income on the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form. Students applying for financial aid have to report income and assets on FAFSA. Most schools use the FAFSA form to determine aid awards. However, if the 529 college saving plan is owned by anyone other than the parent or the student, the distribution is considered as untaxed income on the FAFSA form. In this case, the distributions are counted at a 20%-50% rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Disadvantages of using a 529 plan for college expenses</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Your withdrawals from a 529 plan are tax-free only when the money covers qualified education expenses. You have to use the funds for the intended purpose or pay a penalty of 10% along with income tax on the sum withdrawn.</li>
<li>You only get limited investment options, which restrict the ability of your money to gather its potential returns. This becomes even more disadvantageous if you are a high-risk investor.</li>
<li>The returns from a 529 plan might not be sufficient to combat education inflation in the long run, owing to the limited investment returns.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Advantages of using a Roth IRA for college expenses</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>You contribute after-tax dollars, and your money grows tax-free.</li>
<li>You can get tax-free withdrawals for any reason if you are 59.5 years old and your Roth IRA account is at least five years old.</li>
<li>You can take penalty-free withdrawals from your Roth IRA even before the age of 59.5 or the five-year tenure, provided you use the funds to cover the higher education expenses of your child.</li>
<li>There is no restriction on the usage of funds. You can use your Roth IRA money to pay for your child’s education or any other need. There is no ceiling in terms of Roth IRA qualified education expenses. The money not spent on education costs can be used to support you during retirement.</li>
<li>You get a wider variety of investment options in a Roth IRA, allowing you to unleash the full potential of your money and get high returns in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Disadvantages of using a Roth IRA for college expenses</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The annual contribution limits are low. For 2021, you can only contribute $6,000 or $7,000 if you are 50 years or older. In the long run, the contributions might prove to be insufficient to sponsor college costs of your child.</li>
<li>You cannot contribute to a Roth IRA if you earn above the income eligibility limit. For 2021, if you are a single tax filer and earn more than $140,000, you are ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA. Moreover, if you are married and file taxes jointly, your income should be less than $208,000 for 2021 to be eligible for a Roth IRA.</li>
<li>Unlike 529 plans, there is no state exemption for Roth IRAs.</li>
<li>Roth IRA money is not considered for financial aid purposes. However, if you make withdrawals from the account, it can impact the financial aid package. Because even though the money is not taxed, distributions from the Roth IRA account are considered as your income. The withdrawal amount gets added to your income on the FAFSA form and tallies at a 20%-50% rate, including the tax-exempt return on contributions, which appears as untaxed income.</li>
<li>Using Roth IRA for education means reducing your retirement corpus. Due to the contribution limitations, you can only save a specific amount each year. However, if you use a significant sum of your Roth IRA balance to pay for education expenses, you will affect your retirement financial security. This becomes even more critical at a time when Social Security benefits are insufficient to fund retirement expenses.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Using a grandparent’s Roth IRA for education</strong></h2>
<p>Another medium of covering Roth IRA college expenses is by making use of the grandparent&#8217;s Roth IRA. Grandparents can allow their grandkids to inherit their Roth IRA if the grandkids are listed beneficiaries on a Roth IRA. Moreover, in this case, the inherited Roth IRA will also pass the probate process. There are no annual distributions in a Roth IRA, but an inherited Roth IRA will be subject to minimum required distributions like all other retirement plans. Earlier, the IRS allowed beneficiaries of an inherited Roth IRA to distribute the minimum required distributions over their life expectancy. This facilitated reduction of taxes. However, as per the new IRS rules, non-spousal beneficiaries of an <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/retirement-planning/inherited-iras/">inherited IRA</a> should take minimum required distributions within ten years of the owner’s death. The total distribution should be 100% of the Roth IRA funds. The money withdrawn is not taxable if the inherited Roth IRA is older than five years. But in case of delay in taking the minimum required distributions from a Roth IRA, the IRS will impose a tax penalty of 50% on the amount due.</p>
<p>That said, to use a Roth IRA for college fees, grandparents must list the beneficiary in the form provided by the company that manages the Roth IRA and not in their will. If the grandchild is not in the beneficiary form, the Roth IRA will become a part of the grandparent&#8217;s estate. In this case, even if the child is named in the will as a beneficiary, they will not be considered a designated beneficiary, which could cause estate-distribution issues. In such a case, the inherited Roth IRA will have to be distributed to the grandchildren within five years. This could have a significant impact on need-based financial aid eligibility.</p>
<h2><strong>Using both a 529 college savings plan and a Roth IRA for college expenses</strong></h2>
<p>Overall, both the 529 college savings plan and a Roth IRA have their benefits and drawbacks. This makes choosing one out of the two a bit tricky. But as a parent, you can consider investing in a 529 college savings plan and a Roth IRA if you have the required financial support. In such a case, the advantages of one will compensate for the drawbacks of another. Moreover, you will be able to fund the education expenses without compromising on your retirement financial security. You can use the 529 college savings plan to cover the education costs and then tap your Roth IRA balance to pay for the remaining expenses. The leftover sum in your Roth IRA can stay invested for your retired years.</p>
<h2><strong>To summarize</strong></h2>
<p>Balancing college expenses and retirement plans can be slightly daunting. However, if you use appropriate accounts with sound withdrawal strategies, you can make use of both a 529 college savings plan and a Roth IRA for your child’s education as well as your retirement. You can also consider engaging with a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp">professional financial advisor</a> to intricately understand the functioning of these accounts to make an optimal college and retirement funding strategy.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/education-planning/roth-ira-for-college/">Roth IRA: How to Use it For College</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog">WiserAdvisor - Blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Education planning is a long process that can take many years to finish. Experts recommend that you should start saving for your child’s higher education costs from the moment they are born. This allows you to save optimally over the span of many years. This also removes financial anxiety, compromised dreams, and a stressful life in general. The longer the term, the more time there is for your money to grow in value, make use of the power of compounding, overcome any losses, etc. Starting early also helps you pick the right investment and savings instruments that can offer you the desired returns on your money. You can also consult with a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp">professional financial advisor</a> who can help you to invest wisely and build an education planning strategy to achieve this goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, while most parents concentrate on starting to invest or save early, save aggressively and systematically, and seize all opportunities of financial aid, they sometimes tend to forget the fundamentals of education planning i.e. to align their education planning needs around their child’s ambitions. The current times are a lot different than what they were even a decade ago. Many alternative and offbeat career options have opened up for children that may or may not require a college education anymore. The traditional concept of education and success are changing drastically. Hence, when planning for the future education needs of your children, you must be in sync with your child’s goals and ambitions. Read on to know more.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Reasons why your education planning needs to be circled around your child’s ambitions</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. An education Planning Strategy based on every child</strong> <strong>being</strong><strong> unique: </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">You must acknowledge the fact that every child is unique and different. Just like no two people look the same, they also do not share the same mind and interests. Your child may not look at life from the same lens as you do. Many a time, parents assume that their children will grow up to follow in their footsteps and join the family business. Generational businesses are generally passed on from one generation to another within the same family tree. However, your child may or may not want to be a part of a family-run company. This can in turn, also alter your education planning strategies. For instance, if your child wishes to join your company and requires a college degree to do so, you may have to start saving from an early age to be able to provide your child with the education they need. However, if your child rejects the idea of joining your business and wishes to pursue a career in sports instead, their education planning needs will shift from a business degree to professional sports coaching. This can bring in a different kind of cost for you to cater for. Hence, it is extremely vital for you to understand your child’s interests from a young age, so you can accordingly plan for their future. Saving aimlessly can be a futile attempt with no benefits in the end. On the other hand, systematic and goal-based planning in line with your child’s ambitions can help you save optimally.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. The times are changing so understand your kid’s off-beat career ambition to plan for their education expenses:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gone are the days when being a doctor, lawyer, actor, professor, chef, etc. were a select few professions most people chased after. The 21<sup>st</sup> century and especially the last decade has brought a wave of many new professions into the world. With social media and its increasing relevance in everyday lives, social media managers, influencers, make up artists, painters, You Tubers, ethical hackers, yoga experts, nutritionists, dieticians, trainers, personal stylists, motivational speakers, comedians, film reviewers, decorators, blog writers, Tik Tok stars, etc. have become sort after professions. These career paths do not always require a college degree or even a high school diploma and yet can be extremely rewarding financially. If your child seems to be interested in pursuing such a profession, you may not have to save as much for their education expenses. Surprisingly, many teenagers have already achieved great success on social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, etc. and are also making money through them. It can be helpful for you to talk to your kid about these aspirations and be open to the possibility of your child pursuing such offbeat professions. Supporting them in their endeavors can help them get to their goals sooner. Moreover, if your child wishes to adopt such a career path, you can divert your savings to another goal, as the costs involved here would be a lot less. If your child is making money through social media and still wishes to study further, they can contribute to their education expenses themselves. This can reduce or fully eliminate your burden. Either way, try to be on board with their choice to follow a certain ambition and help them accordingly.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. It helps to plan for education expenses efficiently </strong><strong>by picking the right savings tools to benefit your child: </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As stated in the previous point, it is crucial to understand your child and their capabilities as it can help you plan for their future more optimally. While being supportive provides your children with an emotional cushion to rely on, it also helps you in picking the right savings account or funds that can benefit not only your child but also aid your financial planning goals over the years. For instance, if your child is certain about attending college, a 529 education planning account can be a great savings instrument. A 529 education savings plan is an investment tool that allows parents to save for their children’s future education expenses. The account can be used to cover qualified educational expenses that include tuition fees, the cost of books, room rent, course-related equipment like laptops, etc. This tax-advantaged account is a state-sponsored plan and offers tax saving, the safety of returns, and structured growth on your money. However, unqualified withdrawals can attract a 10% penalty on the earnings. Hence, it is important to understand your child’s inclination towards attending college. If you feel that your child may not go to college, saving in a 529 plan can be a loss for you and result in a penalty. It may be advised to talk to your children every now and then to gauge their interest in getting a college education. It is also important to realistically analyze their caliber. If your child lacks the competence to get into college, saving meticulously in a 529 education account may be a lost cause.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Saving optimally in a 529 education account v/s an IRA account: </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some children are gifted with additional skills that can help them get scholarships to college. If your child excels in sports or has the capability to be the valedictorian of the school one day, you can expect some college scholarships to ease the process for you. Partial or complete scholarships can considerably help parents and students achieve their dreams. But getting a scholarship is a tricky business. You can never be sure of whether or not your child gets one, which makes it hard to depend on them. One thing that can help you here is to encourage your child to perform well in their field of interest to ensure they have a good shot at getting the scholarship. Motivation can greatly help students do better. Additionally, you can continue saving in an account other than the 529 education savings account. A lot of people use the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) as a backup savings fund for education expenses. If the scholarship money does not come through, the funds from an IRA can be used to pay for education costs. On the other hand, if the scholarship does come through, you can simply use the IRA for other qualified expenses, such as a home purchase, retirement, health expenditure, etc. But make sure that you discuss this option with a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp">financial advisor</a> as retirement planning and education planning are two crucial but separate components of your financial plan. Mixing the two should be done carefully and prudently.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. It allows your child to pursue their dreams </strong><strong>when you save for their future education needs: </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Education is essential and can create a path full of opportunities for any individual, but it is not the end of the world. It may also not suit everyone. Hence, try to understand your child’s needs and goals in life outside of education. Some children may be artistically inclined, while others have a niche for numbers. However, no matter what they choose and how many times they change their mind, as parents, you must try to be supportive of their dreams. This can ensure that your children do well in their life and pick a profession they are entirely certain of and can excel at. For instance, your savings can help your child build a business, record music in a professional studio, pay for rent, and a lot more. Let your children decide how they wish to use the money for their career advancement rather than making these decisions for them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>To sum it up</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you spend years planning for your child’s future, make sure to account for the changing times too. Stay up to date with the latest career options and let your children make the most of these rising tides. This will ensure that your child lives their life to the fullest and your hard-earned savings are not wasted on unwanted dreams and ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cost of education in the U.S. has increased more than three times over the last three decades. This is creating a financial burden on students and their parents. Moreover, it is forcing them to focus more on finding educational loans instead of a suitable college. According to a 2020 report by EducationData.org, the average college fee in the U.S is $32,889 per student. With such high costs, parents need to find the right approach to plan and save for their child’s education. That said, even though saving for a child’s education is the main goal, most parents either start too late or do not have sufficient funds to support the high costs. So, if you do not have any plan in place for your child’s future, it is highly advised that you start now.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the best methods you can use to save for your kid’s education:</strong></p>
<h3><strong>529 college plans</strong></h3>
<p>These state-sponsored, tax-advantaged plans are one of the best options to cover higher education costs. This college-savings plan invests your after-tax dollars into bonds and low-cost stocks for optimum diversification. Moreover, you can withdraw your savings without paying any taxes, provided they are used for eligible education-related expenses. Some eligible or qualified educational costs include tuition, room rent, boarding charges, and the cost of books. But in case you use your 529 plan savings for any other non-qualified expenditure, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) charges income tax and a 10% penalty. However, the tax and penalty are charged only on the earnings and not on the contributions. That said, each U.S. state has different rules for a 529 college plan. Hence, it is best to understand each state’s plan in detail and then opt for the best state’s policy, depending on the benefits.</p>
<p>It helps to invest in a 529 as soon as possible because these plans offer considerably high returns, enabling you to comfortably fulfill the educational expenses of your child. As per the College Savings Plan Network, 529 plans rose to a record high of $352.4 billion in assets in the first half of 2019. Even though the COVID-19 situation had a huge impact on the 529 asset balance, bringing it down to $293 billion in March 2020, the plan is expected to regain momentum because of its significant advantages. Apart from the triple tax advantage offered by the 529 plan, you also enjoy flexibility in naming beneficiaries for this account. So, in case the existing beneficiary of your account does not need the funds for higher education, you can change the designated beneficiary in the future to cater to another child’s education. Further, the IRS levies no upper limits on the annual contribution to 529 plans. Each state has a different limit, usually between $235,000 and $529,000. Besides, you can rollover your 529 savings balance into a certified ABLE account to support the non-qualified expenses of disabled kids and young adults. That said, amidst these advantages, it is always advisable to be careful with the withdrawals from this account.</p>
<h3><strong>529 prepaid tuition plans</strong></h3>
<p>Another approach that can help you save well for your child’s education is a 529 prepaid tuition plan.As per reports, college tuition fees rise every year by almost 5%. These costs can be an extreme burden for parents. The 529 prepaid tuition plans allow you to pay a portion or all of your child’s education costs in advance. The cost you pay can be in line with a specific university or an “aspire to” group of institutions. The main benefit that these plans offer is the ability to pay for the costs of the future in the present, thus, allowing you to evade the sharp inflation in the tuition costs. Apart from offering you this benefit, 529 prepaid tuition plans allow your savings to grow tax-free. Moreover, these accounts have no income or age restriction limits and each state offers different but usually very high contribution rates. Similar to a traditional 529 savings plan, prepaid plans also allow you to change your beneficiary, if need be, in the future. However, since 529 prepaid plans are precisely designed to cover educational expenses, they can be disqualified if your child does not study further or if they get a full scholarship. But you can avoid this by either changing the beneficiary or paying a 10% penalty to withdraw the funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Coverdell education savings account</strong></h3>
<p>A Coverdell education savings plan is also a great medium to save money for your child’s education. The Coverdell plan is like a tax-deferred trust, where you can contribute your after-tax money to save for your child’s college, elementary, as well as secondary education costs. This plan allows your funds to grow tax-free and exempts you from any tax charge at the time of withdrawals. However, the distributions from the Coverdell savings account can only be used to fund qualified educational costs. The definition of a qualified education cost in this plan is broader than a traditional 529 college savings plan. Under the Coverdell education savings account, withdrawals taken for primary and secondary school tuition, uniforms, tutors, and other K-12 costs are not levied any tax penalty. In addition to these benefits, the account offers you a wide variety of investments to choose from, unlike a 529 savings plan. But you can only save up to $2,000 annually in this account until the beneficiary is 18 years old.</p>
<h3><strong>Roth IRA</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from being one of the most popular and coveted retirement savings accounts, a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is also a useful tool for education savings. Roth IRA offers numerous benefits and flexibility. When you save funds in a Roth IRA, you only pay taxes on the money you deposit and no taxes on the withdrawals. Owing to this advantage, you can use your Roth IRA money for retirement, as well as to support your child’s future. The best part about this account is that because you invest your after-tax dollars, you can evade higher taxes later in life. Also, your after-tax contributions get a long period to ensure maximum growth potential since you cannot withdraw any savings before the age of 59.5. That said, unlike other educational plans like a 529, a 529 prepaid plan, or a Coverdell education savings account, a Roth IRA allows you increased flexibility when it comes to using the funds.</p>
<p>But before you invest in a Roth IRA, you should know the maximum contribution limits for each year. For 2020, the IRS has set a sum of $6,000 annually. However, if you are aged 50 or older, you can contribute $7,000 annually. If you invest more than the upper limit, you will pay a penalty of 6% every year until the error is revised.</p>
<h2><strong>To sum it up</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to these methods, you can also choose to build a trust for your child’s future, invest money into eligible savings bonds, put funds in a custodial account, invest in an Education Savings Account (ESA), etc. However, each of these options has its pros and cons, which you should study carefully. Pick an option that best matches your financial needs.</p>
<p>You can also consult professional <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp">financial advisors</a> to help you make the best choice.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/education-planning/the-best-approach-to-plan-for-your-childs-college-education/">The Best Approach to Plan for Your Child’s College Education</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog">WiserAdvisor - Blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like all other parents, you would want your child to have a good education and a successful future. For this purpose, you work hard, juggle family schedules, make time for their homework, and do so much more, only to prepare them to take advantage of different life opportunities. The most important foundation of a secure future is education. However, a college education can be outrageously expensive in America. <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp">A financial advisor</a> can partner with you to help evaluate your options and develop an education savings plan to optimize your savings.</p>
<p>As per U.S. News, over the last 20 years, the in-state tuition and fees for public universities in the U.S. have increased by 212%. The out-of-state tuition and fees for public schools have also shot up by 165%. Likewise, private colleges have recorded a rise of 144% in the past 20 years. Further, as per a survey by Fidelity, most parents wish to sponsor at least 65% of their kid’s total cost for college. However, many of these parents have savings to only cover 33% of their target.</p>
<p>Even though the numbers are alarming, there is still hope. You can easily save a significant corpus for your child, even if you have a restricted budget, provided you create a comprehensive plan for education expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the most important factors you should consider:</strong></p>
<h3><strong>1. Determine your needs for your child’s education to set a savings target</strong></h3>
<p>The first step in education planning is to know and acknowledge your needs. For this purpose, ask yourself a few basic questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many children do you have or plan to have in the future?</li>
<li>How many years do you have before they begin college?</li>
<li>Where do you want your child to study? Public or private colleges? In-or out-of-state?</li>
<li>Do you have a specific school or stream you want your child to study?</li>
<li>Will your child continue studying for four years?</li>
<li>Do you expect your child to go to grad school?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the answer to these questions, it will be easier for you to set a savings target. To know how much to save, research the projected costs for college as per your preferences and answers to the questions above. For instance, if you wish to send your child to a top private university, you would likely need to save more than a parent who has plans to send their child to a public university.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Do not compromise your own financial situation while saving for your child’s education </strong></h3>
<p>Once you know your savings target, set a realistic goal and begin your education planning journey. The objective is to simultaneously plan for college costs without jeopardizing your personal financial situation. Even though, as parents, it is natural for you to place your child’s needs before your own, you should ideally not compromise on important financial plans, such as retirement. You can easily borrow for college but borrowing for retirement is tricky and comes with several complications and tax-related issues. The ideal way to go about this is to first align your financial plan. Focus on paying off your pending credit card bills and avoid taking any high-interest debt. It is also advisable to set aside an emergency corpus for the future. Ideally, your emergency fund should be three to six months’ worth of your living expenses. Lastly, stay on track and save for your retirement. All these steps will ensure you do not burden your kids with your living expenses later only because you failed to build a nest egg for your retired years.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Know when to start saving and planning for your child’s education</strong></h3>
<p>Time is your greatest asset when it comes to education planning. As per the College Board, a four-year<strong> </strong>public college for an in-state student will annually cost around $26,820, a four-year public college for an out-of-state student will be nearly $43,280. For private colleges, as per the same parameters, you can expect to pay as high as $54,880 per year. Keeping these numbers in mind, it is never too early to start planning for your child’s education. Irrespective of whether your child or grandchild is just born or is a toddler, the right time to begin saving for their education is now! If you start education planning at a young age, you allow your money more time to grow over the long term. This also means that in case there are any dips or losses, you have a considerably longer time horizon to absorb the losses and rebound. In addition, when you start saving early, you can easily reduce the amount you have to borrow if needed. You can begin saving a small amount initially and gradually increase your savings rate. Even a small portion that you set aside can make a big difference in helping you meet your child’s future’s needs. The best method to do this is to automate your savings.  Planning early also gives you time to assess if your child will qualify for scholarships. Moreover, the money you save affects the financial aid your child qualifies for in the future.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Choose wise mediums to save for their education </strong></h3>
<p>The most common mistake parents make while planning for their child’s education is keeping their money in a savings account. Even though it might seem like a safe option because it is protected from market volatility, it erodes the value of your money in the long run. This way, you end up losing money eventually. This is because even the best of savings accounts that offer high interest rates cannot keep up with the pace of inflation. As per statistics, college costs rise at about two times the general rate of inflation each year. This trend will likely continue in the future too. As per the College Savings Plans Network, the parents of a toddler in 2021 will require $244,667.00 by the time the child is ready for higher education to cover the costs of an in-state, public college for four years. In a private college, the cost will be $553,064. Hence, it is vital to choose the right method to save for your child’s education. You can consider using the following mediums:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>529 college plans: </strong>529 plans are state-sponsored, tax-advantaged plans that allow you to invest after-tax dollars to save for your child’s higher education. The money you contribute is invested in secure bonds and low-cost stocks to garner effective but safe returns in the long run. The account allows your funds to grow tax-free, and your withdrawals are also exempt from taxes, provided they are used to pay for qualified education expenses like tuition, room, boarding, books, etc. If the money is used for non-qualified expenses, a 10% penalty is charged. Each state has different rules for a 529 college plan. You can choose to invest in your state or another state’s 529 education plan, depending on the benefits. Further, you also have the freedom to change the designated beneficiary in the future to cater to another child’s education. Moreover, there is no annual limitation on contributions. But the balance of your 529 account cannot be more than the anticipated fee of qualified higher education. However, you must evaluate your qualified expenses and be cautious with the 529 withdrawal rules. If possible, apply well-in-advance for the withdrawal.</li>
<li><strong>529 prepaid tuition plans: </strong>529 prepaid tuition plans are also another way to pay for your child’s education in the future. These plans help you cover the tuition fees for your child, which is the most draining educational expense. In a 529 prepaid plan, you can pay all or a part of, the costs of education (of a specific university or a group of institutions) in advance. This will help you avoid the future rise in tuition prices, which are expected to jump by 5% each year. 529 prepaid plans have no income or age limits and offer tax<strong>&#8211;</strong>free growth with high contribution rates. Like 529 college plans, you have the flexibility to choose and change the beneficiary in the future to benefit another child or even yourself. However, this plan can become ineligible if your child does not go to college or receives a full scholarship. In such a case, you have an option to change the beneficiary or pay a 10% penalty to withdraw the balance.</li>
<li><strong>Coverdell education savings account: </strong>You can also use the Coverdell education savings account to save for your child’s education. The Coverdell plan functions like a tax-deferred trust. You can contribute after-tax dollars in this account to pay for your child’s college, elementary as well as secondary education Your funds grow tax-free and you do not pay any taxes at the time of withdrawals. However, the distributions from your Coverdell savings plan can only pay for qualified educational outlays. The scope of qualified expenses in this plan is wider than the 529 college savings plan. The Coverdell education savings accounts allow tax-free withdrawals for primary and secondary school tuition, uniforms, tutoring, and other K-12 charges. You also get an extensive assortment of investments to pick from, compared to a 529 plan. However, you can only save $2,000 in this account annually until the recipient is 18 years.</li>
<li><strong>Roth IRA: </strong>Apart from using your Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) to save for retirement, you can also use it for education planning.<strong> </strong>In a Roth IRA, you can save after-tax dollars, earn tax-free growth, and get tax-free withdrawals. This triple-tax benefit makes a Roth IRA a wise choice to plan for your golden years as well as pay for your child’s education. A Roth IRA offers higher flexibility and significant tax benefits as compared to other retirement accounts. Moreover, unlike other retirement accounts, such as a 401(k), there are no Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) in a Roth IRA. However, you cannot withdraw your funds before the age of 59.5. This means your savings accumulate interest for a longer time horizon. But when it comes to paying for your child’s education expenses, this restriction on withdrawal can cause a hassle. It is possible to overcome this drawback through effective time management. You can use other accounts to cover education fees initially and deploy Roth IRA funds for higher education expenses later. Roth IRA provides you with a wider investment basket and gives you the liberty to use your funds as per your choice, unlike other plans like 529 college savings plans, 529 prepaid plans, and Coverdell education savings accounts. For 2021, you can contribute up to $6,000 in your Roth IRA. If you are 50 years or older, you can invest up to $7000 annually. For contributions above these limits, you will incur a penalty of 6% for every year until the fault is corrected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these mediums, you can also consider putting your money in a custodial account such as UGMAs and UTMAs (Uniform Gift to Minors Act and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act). Alternatively, you can invest in mutual funds, set up a trust, take a permanent life insurance plan, or consider taking a home equity loan, if needed, to fund your child’s education expenses.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Involve your children in planning for their higher education</strong></h3>
<p>If your child is in high school or college, you can consider discussing education expenses with them easily. If your children understand the financial values of their college funding decisions, it will help them make better choices.For instance, if you have taken a loan to pay for your child&#8217;s education, it is good to keep your children informed. The college your child chooses or the field of study they opt for has a big influence on their salaries, and in turn, their loan repaying abilities. Moreover, this will help your children understand the implications of borrowing and might encourage them to shoulder some responsibility for their choices. As per a study conducted by the College Savings Foundation in 2019, 89% of the students plan to work to manage their college costs. Most students do not expect their parents to bear the financial brunt of their education alone and want to accept the charge for funding their education.</p>
<h2><strong>To sum it up</strong></h2>
<p>If you wish to give your child the gift of good education without burdening them with student debt, you may want to start planning for their education as soon as possible.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Self-employment can be rewarding. You are your boss. You make your rules. You earn more, enjoy greater flexibility, and your work satisfaction level is high. And while all this can sometimes come at the cost of long hours, stress, and years of struggle, in most cases, the benefits of self-employment outweigh the cons. In the U.S., there are an estimated 16 to 25.5 million self-employed individuals. One possible disturbing factor about self-employment is the irregularity in income. As a self-employed person, there are high chances that your income varies from year to year. If last year was unusually good, the coming year might not be as profitable or could be even better than the previous one. Nothing is certain. While tactics like budgeting and keeping reserves can help minimize the impact of uncertainty, these strategies still cannot always sufficiently support the education expenses of your child.</p>
<p>Hence, as self-employed parents, it is advisable to plan the education expenses of your child and create a plan for their future well-in-time. Moreover, the rising education costs in the country have further aggravated the need for education planning. College tuition fees have skyrocketed in the last 30 years. The average cost of a four-year public institution has shot up by 213% over the last three decades. In the past decade alone, the cost of public college tuition has increased by 29%. The cost of private college tuition has risen by 25%. With such numbers, it is likely for parents to be worried about the future of their children.</p>
<p>Here are some tips that self-employed parents can use to plan for their child’s education:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in different 529 college plans to save for your child’s education costs: </strong>The 529 college savings plans are one of the most effective ways to save for your child’s future. If you begin investing in these plans at the right time, you can easily cover the education expenses of your child. 529 college plans are state-sponsored, tax-advantaged policies that allow you to invest your after-tax dollarsto adequately cover the cost of higher education. The money you save in these accounts is further invested in different secure bonds and low-cost stocks, generating competitive returns in the long-run. Moreover, the growth in this account is tax-deferred. And, you can take tax-free withdrawals from your 529 plan if the funds are used for a qualified purpose. As per the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), qualified education expenses include tuition, boarding, and books. In some special cases, such as scholarships, the IRS permits funds to be used for other purposes too. However, in general, when the funds are used for a non-qualified purpose, you have to pay federal income tax along with a 10% penalty on the earnings. Further, it is important to note that these plans offer significantly higher returns. Apart from the triple tax advantage, these plans also allow you to change your beneficiary in the future. This will be helpful in a situation where your first nominee does not require the funds, has received a scholarship, or has quit studying. In such cases, you can flexibly alter the beneficiary to name another child. 529 plans vary by each state, and the limit is usually between $235,000 and $529,000. As self-employed parents, this works well in your favor as your income is uncertain, and you can choose to contribute as per your financial capability each year. You can even convert your 529 college plan into a certified ABLE account. This allows you to support the non-qualified expenses of disabled kids and young adults. Alternatively, a type of 529 plan called the 529 prepaid tuition plan can also work well for self-employed parents. These plans primarily sponsor your child&#8217;s tuition fees, which per experts are expected to rise by 5% each year. Hence, with a prepaid 529 tuition plan, you can pay all or a part of your child’s education cost in advance. The advance fee can be determined according to the aspired university or institution. As self-employed parents, you benefit from this provision as you cannot predict the exact inflow of cash. So, it is best to make the investments now when you have a sufficient balance. It further helps you evade the impact of inflation on the future tuition cost. The 529 prepaid plans mimic a 529 college plan and offer the same tax benefits. However, if your child quits studying or secures a full scholarship, the prepaid plan is disqualified unless you name another beneficiary or withdraw the money after paying a 10% penalty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a Coverdell education savings account (ESA) for a broader choice of qualified expenses to cover your child education costs: </strong>The 529 plans alone can sometimes be inadequate to sponsor your child’s education. In this case, you can use other sound investments like a Coverdell education savings plan. You can choose to contribute to this account if your child is under the age of 18. This account works like a tax-deferred trust. You make after-tax contributions, your funds grow tax-deferred, and your distributions are also tax-free, provided they are used for qualified education expenses. As per the Coverdell plan, qualified education costs cover primary and secondary school tuition, uniforms, tutoring, and other K-12 expenses. The scope of qualified education expenses is broader in these plans in comparison to the 529 college plans. You can easily use your Coverdell account balance to finance the elementary and secondary education costs of your child. Further, this plan gives you a broader choice of investments in comparison to a 529 plan. However, you would be restricted by an upper contribution limit of $2,000. But as a self-employed parent, this does not prove to be disadvantageous if you use the Coverdell education savings account as a secondary funding option. Moreover, in case your child does not go to college in the future, you have the option to transfer the funds to another child or a relative.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use a Roth IRA to plan your child’s education expenses</strong>: A Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is also a great medium to plan for your child’s education expenses. Roth IRAs allow you to invest after-tax dollars, earn tax-free returns, and take tax-free withdrawals. Due to the triple tax advantages, Roth IRAs have become an ideal choice to fund retirement years as well as your child’s education outlays. As a self-employed parent, if you can, you should consider opening a Roth IRA account in addition to the 529 savings plan and the Coverdell account. This is because a Roth IRA offers you more flexibility, significant returns, and greater tax benefits. Besides, in comparison to the above-mentioned plans, a Roth IRA gives you more freedom in terms of using your distributions. You can use your Roth IRA savings as you deem fit, unlike the Coverdell or the 529 college savings plans. Also, the investment basket in a Roth IRA is much wider, providing an opportunity to garner even higher returns. However, a Roth IRA comes with an upper contribution limitation. For 2021, you can deposit $6,000 annually. If you are above the age of 50, you can contribute an additional sum of up to $7000 annually. For contributions made beyond this limit, the IRS levies a 6% penalty every year until the error is solved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in a sound life insurance policy to help fund your child’s future education expenses: </strong>For self-employed parents, life insurance policies can deliver two benefits. One, you get a secure life insurance cover. Second, you can accumulate a corpus for your child’s future education. In a cash-value-based life insurance policy, a part of the premium you pay is used to secure your life, whereas the other part of the premium is diverted to a separate cash-value account. The funds in this account grow at a predetermined rate, which is usually between 3% and 6%. Generally, whole life insurance plans are ideal in such scenarios. In these plans, the insurance company credits your account with a defined sum at a pre-agreed frequency. Further, the funds grow tax-deferred like a 529 college savings plan. However, if you are more of a risk-taker, you can opt for variable life insurance. This particular policy will invest a part of the premiums you pay in different market-linked securities. You can choose and govern your investments. But, the returns of your account are based on the performance of the underlying investment choices. You could generate greater returns, but you will also be undertaking a significant risk in this case. Alternatively, as self-employed parents, you can use your life insurance policy as collateral to procure a loan against it. The amount of loan can be used to pay for your kid’s education expenses. But the loan amount you take will be reduced from the insurance plan’s maturity or death benefits if you fail to pay back the loan in time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take a </strong><strong>Federal Parent</strong> <strong>PLUS or private loan to fund your child’s education expenses: </strong>If all other options above fail to meet your requirements, you can use the PLUS loans. As per a recent study from , approximately 3.6 million parents took out $96 billion in outstanding loans under the federal Parent PLUS program. PLUS loans let you borrow a sum equivalent to the college tuition fee by using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Further, to reduce your financial stress, the federal government offers several relaxations, enabling you to pay back the PLUS loans more conveniently. But, if you fail to get a PLUS loan, you can always consider taking a private loan at a lower interest rate from a bank or private lender. Private student loan rates may levy lower interest rates than federal loans, provided your credit score is 670 or higher. Besides, interest on student loans taken for college tuition or vocational school is also tax-deductible. For qualified students, the deductible limit is $2,500. However, individuals with an income of $70,000 or higher are not eligible for this exemption. In the case of married couples, the exemption limit is up to a total income of $140,000.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up an educational trust to fund your child’s education costs in the future: </strong>As a self-employed parent, you might own a few assets that could help preserve the financial future of your children. You can place your listed assets in an educational trust and use them to fund your child’s education cost in the future. The trust will hold the assets on behalf of the child for a particular period. You can use the assets and later transfer them to the child once the tenure is over. In other cases, if your child is a minor, you can choose to invest in structured/custodial accounts like UTMAs (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) or UGMAs (Uniform Gift to Minors Act). These accounts allow you to direct specific assets in your child’s account and invest them further for higher returns until your child reaches the legal age of trust termination. The legal age of trust termination varies as per the state in which the trust was established. In most cases, the legal age is between 18 and 21 years. A major reason why a trust works best for self-employed parents is that there is no restriction on how to use the money. Moreover, there is no penalty on withdrawals. So, if in the future, your child does not plan to take up higher studies, you can use the trust assets to sustain your retirement expenses or even leave the trust as a legacy for your children. Further, setting up a trust helps you lower your estate tax burden. However, the primary beneficiary of the trust cannot be changed later in life.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>To sum it up </strong></h2>
<p>Apart from using these investment tools to plan for your child’s education, self-employed parents can also take advantage of several tax benefits offered by the government for education expenses. One such assistance is the lifetime learning credit (LLC) that is available for tuition and similar incidentals from undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree courses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether it is the holiday season or a special occasion like a birthday, graduation, etc., gifts can be a great way to show appreciation, admiration, and love for your children. However, as parents, your responsibility towards your child goes beyond traditional gifts like toys, books, family vacations, a trip to the mall, or gadgets. As opposed to these, financial gifts can offer your children more advantages. They can use these funds or assets for their career or educational advancement. Financial gifts also bring in more economic security and stability that can help your children tide through some tough times.</p>
<p>As you spend your money on a gift, ensuring that your hard earned money brings in some value to your child’s life is important.</p>
<p>Here are 8 financial gifts that you can consider gifting your children.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Contributing to their college fund</strong></h3>
<p>Regardless of your child’s age, a contribution to their college fund or towards other higher education expenses can be instrumental in their success later. Instead of giving your kids some cash, you can contribute the same to a 529 education savings account or any other account that you are using to save for their future education costs. Not only will this ensure that your child uses the money for a good reason but the power of compounding will grow your contributions over time and increase its value. Moreover, this may eliminate the need for a student loan later in your child’s life. This way, they can start their career without the burden of having to pay back an education loan and use their income to invest or save further.</p>
<p>Contribution to a child’s college fund is also something that grandparents and relatives can resort to. If the child is already in college, you can cut a direct check to the university or make a donation to the college in the child’s name. In the case of grandparents, who may be retired, gifting can result in lower estate taxes too. Hence, not only does such a gift benefit the child but can also benefit the person giving the gift.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Opening a savings account</strong></h3>
<p>Another option that you can consider is opening a savings account for your child. This can be a bank savings account or even a certificate of deposit. The money will be safe in the account and you will be able to monitor how your child uses the funds. In the case of parents who may be worried that their children can misuse their funds, a savings account can be a good solution. Moreover, the money accumulates returns over time which in turn, can help your child with their expenses. Savings accounts can also be a learning experience for your children, as they get to acquire and imbibe the principle of systematic savings. This can benefit them for life as they will likely follow the same practice even when they are older. Moreover, the savings can be used for a number of expenses, such as education, learning a new skill or hobby, travelling abroad, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Invest in their name</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to investing, there is a wide range of options that you can choose from. Buying stocks can be one way to go. There are no limitations on the number of stocks you can buy and you can keep investing as and when time permits. Stocks can come with high risks involved, so make sure to discuss your options with a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp">financial advisor</a>. However, small investments made on behalf of a child would not have the same impact on your risk tolerance. You can also invest in government, corporate, or municipal bonds if you want lower risk with steady returns. Mutual funds, exchange traded funds, etc., are all viable options here.</p>
<p>If you plan on using your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) for your child’s higher education expenses, you can make a contribution to your IRA too. However, this has to be within the yearly limit of your IRA. In 2021, the limit is fixed at $6000 for investors below the age of 50 and $7000 for investors aged 50 or more. But this is only suitable for parents who plan to use their IRA for their children’s education costs. Otherwise, the funds may be stuck in the account and be used for qualified expenses only and may not always benefit your child. If your child is working and earning an income, you can open an IRA in their name as well. But your child will not be able to withdraw these funds till the age of 59.5.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Buy a life insurance plan</strong></h3>
<p>A life insurance plan can offer your child financial protection in your absence. It can cater to their needs and allow them to carry on with the same standard of living as before. You can consider purchasing a life insurance plan and naming the child as the nominee. In the unfortunate event of your death, the benefits from the plan can help them cover their education expenses, food and utility costs, start a business, or even pay back loans. This is especially important in the case of single parents as their children do not have another parent to depend on.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Purchase some real estate</strong></h3>
<p>This may not suit all parents as the costs involved can be high. However, if your budget permits, purchasing real estate can be beneficial for your child in the long run. The costs of real estate can appreciate substantially. Moreover, your child can enjoy flexibility over how they wish to use this investment. They can keep the property for themselves. They can also use it as collateral for a loan or sell it in the future to gain a profit and use the money to cover their expenses, such as loan settlements, education expenses, etc. In addition to this, real estate fits well into the category of family assets, in the sense that it can be carried forward to future generations too. Moreover, it takes the burden off your child as they will have a real estate asset with them and can use it when the time comes to buy their own house.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Donate to charitable organizations</strong></h3>
<p>You can get a gift certificate for a charitable organization that your child likes. The money can be donated in your child’s name and can go towards a cause that is close to your child’s heart. You can give your child a gift certificate for a charity on every birthday or any special holiday. This can be another learning opportunity for your child. They can learn the significance of moral and ethical gestures and understand the importance of sharing with the less fortunate. Donations can also offer tax breaks and be used as an effective tax saving strategy.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Give cash</strong></h3>
<p>Although this can be tricky sometimes, cash too, can make for a great gift. It can seem impersonal to some, but gifting your child cash gives them the chances to use it as they please. They can use the money to buy what they like or save for a bigger goal in their future. However, this may not be a good choice if your child is likely to misuse the money. Even if you trust your child to use it for something meaningful, it may help to be more involved in your child’s decision and help them understand the different ways in which they can spend their gift. You can consider giving them money in installments to make sure they do not spend it in one place. You can also make an agreement with them to spend a part of the money and save the rest for future expenses. This can again be a chance for you to teach them money management skills that they can use and incorporate in their lives in the future. Little children can be gifted a coin collector or piggy bank where they can save a portion of their money. Older children, on the other hand, can use a bank account as stated above and continue their savings there.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Establish a trust fund</strong></h3>
<p>You can set up a trust fund for your children that they can access when they are adults. This eliminates the chances of money mismanagement as your child gets the fund when they are more mature to handle the money. However, you may require a trustee to manage the funds till your child is old enough to take over the trust fund. There are different types of trust funds, and a <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp">financial advisor</a> can help you decide the best as per your requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>To sum it up</strong></h2>
<p>Gifts can mean different things to different people. However, as parents, you can choose suitable gifts to teach your children the principles of financial planning from a young age. Systematic savings, frugal living, spending mindfully, etc., are some things that children can pick up as they grow up. While talking to your kids may not have the same impact always, small gestures like conscious gifts can leave a lasting impression on them and help them plan their own finances and life better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to parenting, the list of responsibilities can be a long one. Right from offering your children a safe and lovable home to tending to their medical needs, the duty of a parent never ends. Among these, the most crucial one is perhaps offering your child with the right opportunities for education. Unfortunately, saving for higher education, especially college, is an uphill task. The costs of education are soaring in the country. Coupled with inflation, the final outcome can be astronomical. This is why it is important to start saving early and take advantage of the power of compounding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several ways to save for higher education costs. The 529 education savings account is a common choice made by parents. Apart from this, you can also invest in the market, keep a dedicated bank account for your child’s educational expenses, or use an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to fund a child’s college fees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you find yourself leaning towards using an IRA to pay for education expenses, here are some things you must keep in mind.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Know the rules for withdrawals from an IRA</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the IRA makes for a good pick to cater to educational expenses, there are some rules that apply to it that may or may not suit you. Generally, if you withdraw funds from a retirement account, such as the IRA or a 401(k) account, the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) levies a 10% penalty if the withdrawal is made before the age of 59.5. However, there are some exemptions to this rule. You can withdraw funds without incurring the 10% penalty for qualified expenses, including:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>First time home purchase</li>
<li>Health related expenditure not covered under an insurance plan</li>
<li>College tuition</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Moreover, even though college tuition is a qualified expense for which you can make withdrawals without paying a penalty, there are some rules to follow here, such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The college expenses should be for yourself, your spouse, your child, or your grandchild.</li>
<li>The student should be at least half time enrolled in a college or educational institution. This includes a public, private, or non-profit college, university, or post-secondary institution as well as vocational schools.</li>
<li>The institution that the student goes to should be eligible to participate in a student aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">The funds from an IRA can be used to cover a wide range of expenses apart from the tuition fee, including books, supplies, equipment required for the course, room rent, and boarding expenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A crucial point to note is that even though the qualified withdrawals do not attract a 10% penalty, you still have to pay income tax on the withdrawals. In addition to this, the total amount withdrawn cannot exceed the qualified expenses.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Understand the difference between using a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA for education expenses</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The withdrawal rules are not the same for a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA. Although both these retirement accounts can be used to cover qualified educational expenses, the treatment of taxes is different in both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you may know, a Roth IRA is funded by your after tax dollars, so your money grows tax free. On the other hand, a traditional IRA is funded by your before tax dollars and your money grows tax deferred. While there is no 10% penalty for making early withdrawals for qualified reasons, you will have to pay income tax on withdrawals made from a traditional IRA. The Roth IRA withdrawals, however, will not attract any income tax.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, there are rules to follow here, as well. In order to draw tax free earnings from a Roth IRA:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The Roth account should be open for at least 5 years. This is calculated from January 1 of the year when you made the first contribution. In case of a Roth conversion from a traditional account, the 5 year period is calculated from January 1 of the year you made the conversion.</li>
<li>The tax payer should be 59.5 or older.</li>
<li>The tax payer becomes</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">The contributions can be withdrawn even if the tax payer is not 59.5. However, if both the contributions and the earnings are withdrawn before the age of 59.5 and the Roth IRA has been held for less than 5 years, the earnings will be taxable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping these factors in view, the Roth IRA can be a better option out of the two IRAs with its lower tax liability.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Use an education IRA</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can consider using an education IRA to cover higher education expenses. An education IRA is a tax-advantaged account that allows you to invest for the purpose of higher education. It is also known as the Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA). An education IRA allows tax deferred growth on your contributions. And qualified withdrawals can be made tax free.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can make contributions to an ESA till the child turns 18. However, the funds can be used by the child till the age of 30. Some people misunderstand this and keep contributing money till the child turns 30. In this case, a 6% tax is levied on the contributions made after the age of 18.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just like any other IRA, an education IRA can also be used to cover several college-related expenses, such as:</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Tuition fees</li>
<li>Cost of books</li>
<li>Travel expenses</li>
<li>Supplies</li>
<li>Course related equipment</li>
<li>Computer or laptop</li>
<li>Room rent</li>
<li>Boarding charges, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Keep in mind the repercussions of using an IRA on FAFSA</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you are looking forward to using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), withdrawing funds from an IRA can obstruct the amount of financial aid you qualify for. In the case of an education IRA, if you apply for financial aid and use funds from the ESA, your financial aid eligibility can be reduced by approximately 5.64% of the amount of money you have in your ESA at the time of filling the application for financial aid.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even if you use a traditional or Roth IRA, your financial aid eligibility will still be lowered. When a student applies for financial aid, they also have to report their income and owned assets. This helps FAFSA decide whether a family can afford the costs of college education or not. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid takes into account a family’s tax information from the last two years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If, as a parent, you own a retirement account like a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, FAFSA will see them as your financial assets. However, if you withdraw funds from any of these accounts two years before applying for financial aid, FAFSA will consider it as your income.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IRA funds can reduce financial aid by as much as half. This holds true even if you only withdraw your contributions and not the earnings. While the withdrawals made from contributions may not be counted in your taxable income for the year, they will still be seen as an income by FAFSA.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Having said that, the child can still apply for FAFSA and use the IRA funds for higher education expenses. But the financial aid may be reduced. Hence, it is important to account for these differences while planning for future costs.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Make sure you have another retirement account for your retirement expenses</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The contribution limits for an IRA are fixed each year. For 2021, these are:</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>$6,000 for investors below the age of 50.</li>
<li>Investors aged 50 or older can add an extra $1,000 as a catch-up contribution every year, bringing the total to $7,000.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since the limits are prefixed and it is not possible to surpass these, your IRA may have limited funds. If you use one account for your child’s education costs and your retirement, you may end up with insufficient savings. It can also be challenging to make up for lost time and money in your retirement, since you would be older and may have health concerns that prohibit you from working or earning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, it is essential to have enough retirement savings. You could invest in the market, open a 401(k) retirement account, or buy a life annuity. Regardless of what you choose, make sure you start retirement planning at an early age, so you do not end up compromising your child’s future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you find yourself with inadequate funds for retirement, it may not be advisable to use your IRA for your children’s education expenses. In this case, you can consider a student loan. Even though the interest rates are high, your child will have plenty of time to repay the money. On the contrary, taking a loan in your retirement can be tougher to repay.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>To sum it up</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">An IRA makes for a good pick in many scenarios. They also hold an advantage over 529 accounts in some ways, primarily because if your child does not intend on going to college, your 529 account will attract a penalty when you withdraw funds for non-qualified expenses. An IRA, on the other hand, can be used for a number of reasons. However, you need to make sure that your other retirement savings are safe, secure, and adequate before you use your IRA on a child. This can be done with efficient education and retirement planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Education and retirement planning are both long term processes and a financial advisor can help you ace it. <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/match_advisors.asp?kwd=ira_to_pay_for_education&amp;pagetype=blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can use our free tool to reach out to upto 3 professional financial advisors</a> today and find the one that best matches your needs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog/education-planning/5-tips-on-using-an-ira-to-pay-for-education/">5 Tips on Using an IRA to Pay for Education</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.wiseradvisor.com/blog">WiserAdvisor - Blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to college education, the costs involved can be overwhelming. Right from the tuition money to the cost of travel, books, course-related equipment and more, parents and students often have to turn to student loans to accommodate these expenses. While long-term savings accounts, such as a 529 education account, Individual Retirement Account (IRA), etc. can make things easier for parents and students, there are other ways to reduce the overall expenses too. Education tax credits ease some tax liability for both parents and students and make for a great tax strategy.</p>
<h2><strong>What are education tax credits?</strong></h2>
<p>Education tax credits are a unique form of tax credit that tax payers can claim for paying qualified educational costs, such as college fee, cost of books, supplies, etc. These costs should be for a post-secondary school like a college or university. There are two types of education tax credits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>American Opportunity Education Credit</strong>: This form of education tax credit allows you to save up to $2,500 in taxes. This credit is available to students in the first four years of their post-secondary course. In addition to this, students need to enroll at a school that qualifies for the federal student aid program.</li>
<li><strong>Lifetime Learning Credit:</strong> This credit can be availed by people of different ages and educational backgrounds and can be claimed at any year of the degree or course. This credit allows you to save up to $2,000 in taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are 6 important pointers to know about education tax credits:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Understanding the American Opportunity Education Credit</strong></h3>
<p>The American Opportunity Education Credit can be availed if the student goes to a college, university, non-profit institution, or vocational institution. 40% of this credit is refundable even if you have no tax liability at all. However, in order to claim the credit, the student should have enrolled at least half time for one academic course in the financial year when the tax is being filed. This credit can be claimed for educational expenses for yourself, your spouse, or your dependent children. Room expenses and boarding costs are not included in the list of qualified expenses. However, you can consider tuition fees, cost of books, supplies, course-related equipment, etc. Another vital thing to remember about this tax credit is that if any felony charges are found against the student, the American Opportunity Education Credit can no longer be availed of.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Understanding the Lifetime Learning Credit</strong></h3>
<p>The Lifetime Learning Credit can be used by a broader range of students as compared to the American Opportunity Education Credit. While the latter is only eligible to students pursuing post-secondary education, the former can be availed by students pursuing undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, as well as professional courses and degrees. Since there is no time limit to avail this credit, even adults pursuing studies at a later stage in life can qualify for this tax credit. As opposed to the American Opportunity Education Credit, this credit is not refundable. But you can claim it for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent child. Unlike the other credit, even a student charged with a felony can claim this credit. The credit can be used for expenses, such as buying books, supplies, equipment, etc., but boarding expenses and room rent are not included.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Only one credit can be claimed in a year for one student</strong></h3>
<p>One tax payer can only claim one credit for one student in a year. So, if you claim the American Opportunity Education Credit for one child, and you have another child, you will have to claim the Lifetime Learning Credit for the second kid. Since the rules of eligibility and offerings of these credits differ, you can choose which one is more suitable for each of your children and make an appropriate decision.</p>
<h3><strong>4. The eligibility criteria for claiming education tax credits may differ each year</strong></h3>
<p>The eligibility criteria to claim education tax credits are decided by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) for every financial year. As of 2020,</p>
<ul>
<li>For individual tax payers, the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) should not be more than $80,000. If your MAGI is more than $80,000, but under $90,000, you can qualify for a lower credit amount. However, you cannot claim any credit with a MAGI of more than $90,000.</li>
<li>For married individuals filing jointly, the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) should not be more than $160,000. If your joint MAGI is more than $160,000, but under $180,000, you can qualify for a lower credit amount. However, you cannot claim any credit with a joint MAGI of more than $180,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Form 8863 should be submitted to claim the credit</strong></h3>
<p>In order to claim any of the two credits, you need to fill the Form 8863 and submit it with your income tax return form. The form requires information, such as the student’s name, Social Security number, address, etc. You also need to calculate the total credit amount and enter it in the form before submitting it.</p>
<h3><strong>6. An education tax credit is different from a tax deduction</strong></h3>
<p>A lot of people assume that a tax credit is the same thing as a tax deduction. However, these two play varying roles in your income tax return. Tax deductions primarily depend on your total tax liability. They are calculated as per the income tax margin you fall into. Thus, if your income increases, your tax liability also increases. Tax credits, on the other hand, can reduce a person’s liability as they are directly deducted from the total tax dues. These can also be refundable. For instance, the American Opportunity Education Credit is refundable up to 40% even if you have no tax due.</p>
<h2><strong>To sum it up</strong></h2>
<p>Getting the education you need and deserve is a hard goal to achieve in today’s times. With the rising costs of education in the country, it is becoming increasingly hard for parents and students to cover education-related expenses. Moreover, with growing competition in the professional world, taking up a student loan can be a tough option. However, education tax credits bring in some aid to tax payers in this arduous journey.</p>
