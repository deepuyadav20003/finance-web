Investment advisors:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An investment advisor offers investment advice to you and helps you pick the most profitable investment options for you and your goals. Additionally, your investment advisor may also manage your investments on your behalf and take calls related to the entry and exit of your investments to safeguard your investment portfolio. If you\u2019re looking for specialized advice on securities and investments, you can go for an investment advisor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Financial_planners\"><\/span>2. Financial planners:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A financial planner is a professional who assists you with holistic financial planning, offering you exhaustive advice and services related to retirement planning, education planning, budgeting, investment planning, debt settlement, tax planning, etc. A financial planner might be suitable for you if you are looking for holistic financial planning.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Wealth_managers\"><\/span>3. Wealth managers:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As the name suggests, wealth managers manage accounts of wealthy investors and exclusively work with high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals only. Typically, wealth managers offer services such as investment planning, business succession planning, tax planning, estate planning, asset acquisition, and more. If you are a high-net-worth investor, then a wealth manager would be ideal for you, as they have experience in managing high volumes of wealth.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Retirement_planners\"><\/span>4. Retirement planners:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A retirement planner can help you with more than just ensuring you save enough for retirement; they can also assist you with other areas of financial planning such as creating an effective withdrawal strategy for your retirement years, making penalty-free withdrawals from your retirement saving accounts, planning for rising healthcare and long-term care expenses, as well as tax management and estate planning if needed. Consider hiring a retirement planner if you are nearing retirement and wish to plan efficiently for a comfortable retirement lifestyle in the coming years.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Robo-advisors\"><\/span>5. Robo-advisors:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Robo-advisors are digital advisors who use computer algorithms to recommend investments based on the information given by you. These virtual advisors assess the information given by you to evaluate your risk tolerance and recommend investments and savings instruments that match your financial goals and investment concerns. Further, even though robo-advisors are a convenient way to receive expert financial advice, they lack the human touch. Robo advisors are best suited for individuals who have a low amount of capital to invest and are looking for cheaper alternatives to start investing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_Once_you_have_determined_the_type_of_financial_advisor_you_need_start_your_search_for_an_advisor_that_meets_your_financial_requirements\"><\/span>Step 2: Once you have determined the type of financial advisor you need, start your search for an advisor that meets your financial requirements.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are several options available to you to look for a financial advisor. Since every individual has a unique set of financial needs and goals, they may require an advisor who holds financial expertise in that particular domain. For instance, someone looking to invest in securities would need the services of an investment advisor while a person thinking to retire and build a retirement corpus would need to hire a retirement planner. If you do not know where to begin looking for a financial advisor, you can try the following options listed below:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Search_engines\"><\/span>1. <strong>Search engines<\/strong>:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem obvious at first, but you cannot overlook the power of a search engine. A quick Google search for &#8220;financial advisor near me&#8221;, \u201cbest financial advisors\u201d or \u201cfinancial advisor in &lt;your city name&gt;\u201d etc. can provide you with a list of suitable financial advisors that you may consider reaching out to for your financial needs. You can use popular search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo to search for financial advisors who practice in your city or state. Note that ads usually appear first on google search results, followed by organic search results below. It is good practice to consider all options before making your final decision.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Recommendations_from_family_friends_or_colleagues\"><\/span>2. Recommendations from family, friends or colleagues:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can also reach out to your circle of friends and family to suggest someone who they have worked with before. It is easier to trust someone who has been vouched for by someone you know. However, note that there may also be a disadvantage if you go down this route. Each individual has unique financial needs and finances. Hence, a financial advisor who is the right fit for your friend or aunt may not be best suited to meet your needs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Using_an_online_%E2%80%98find_a_financial_advisor_match_service\"><\/span>3.

An advisor\u2019s designation indicates their degree of knowledge and training, and there are over 100 different types of advisor certifications and designations for them to choose from. Below are some of the well-known designations you may look out for:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_CFA_Chartered_Financial_Analyst\"><\/span>1. CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst):<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A chartered financial analyst, or a CFA, is a designation awarded by the CFA Institute and is recognized worldwide. Candidates who pass three levels of exams which cover subjects like accounting, economics, money management, ethics, and security analysis qualify to receive this designation. A CFA focuses on designing a portfolio with suitable investments.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_CFP_Certified_Financial_Planner\"><\/span>2. CFP (Certified Financial Planner):<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A CFP is a recognition of expertise in the areas of financial planning such as investing, taxes, insurance, estate planning, and retirement. The certification is issued by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_ChFC_Chartered_Financial_Consultant\"><\/span>3. ChFC (Chartered Financial Consultant):<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While a ChFC might be a lesser well known designation than a CFP, it actually involves additional training in financial planning than a CFP in order to hold the designation. Specifically, while a ChFC requires the same core curriculum as a CFP, it involves further education on improving one&#8217;s skills in wealth management and other areas of financial planning. Candidates are required to pass 8 courses and are also required to complete full-time work in a related field for at least three years. A ChFC provides financial advice and services pertaining to tax planning, retirement planning, investment and estate planning, etc. Hence, choosing a ChFC might be a good idea if you\u2019re looking for someone with knowledge and experience in the financial planning space.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_Create_a_list_of_questions_to_ask_the_financial_advisor\"><\/span>Step 4: Create a list of questions to ask the financial advisor<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finding an advisor can be challenging, especially one that you can trust. Having a list of questions that you can ask potential advisors at the time of hiring can help you make a decision and choose one that best matches your needs and goals. Questions such as whether they are a fiduciary, how they get paid, and what their investment philosophy is are good places to start. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/financial-advisor-guide\/questions-to-ask-your-financial-advisor\/\"><strong>Click here<\/strong><\/a> for a detailed list of questions to ask advisors when interviewing them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"To_conclude\"><\/span>To conclude<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The assistance of a financial advisor in growing and managing your finances is highly recommended as they can help you effectively and strategically plan for a secure and comfortable financial future.
