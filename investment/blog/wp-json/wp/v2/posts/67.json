Assess your current financial standing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Take this as the first step or maybe as a step that you take even before you finally give retirement a serious thought.&nbsp; This is especially most important for the ones who are looking for an early retirement checklist. Create a balance sheet and assess where you stand financially. Take into account all your assets &#8211; savings, property, shares, insurance, etc. Next, subtract all your debts and liabilities. This sheet will not only help you understand how your financial status looks like but will also give you a clear idea of whether you are financially ready for retirement or not.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Create_a_surplusemergency_fund\"><\/span>2. Create a surplus\/emergency fund<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Emergencies don&#8217;t knock with prior notice. Handling emergencies becomes especially tricky when it comes to retirement finances. Ensure you set aside a certain amount from your savings for emergencies. Having insurance additionally will come handy here. Basically, it&#8217;s ideal to avoid a hand to mouth situation post-retirement. Hence, this step, that right now may seem trivial, will really keep you covered in the long run.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Understand_your_current_debts_and_liabilities\"><\/span>3. Understand your current debts and liabilities<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>For a peaceful retired life, it is of utmost importance that you start getting rid of your debt as early as possible. Debt management would include taking stock of your outstanding liabilities, prioritizing them, and devising a plan for clearing them out. Your liabilities can include house\/property expenses (rents, taxes, liabilities), credit card debts, bank loans, leisure expenses, taxation, insurance premium payments, etc.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Map_a_post-retirement_budget\"><\/span>4. Map a post-retirement budget<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A good plan is one that is thought through \u2013 both in terms of research and detailing. Here too, this part of the checklist requires you to think for the future and calculate the expected sources of income and also your expected expenditure. Your post-retirement sources of income can include social security benefits, pension, return on investments, etc.<\/p>\n<p>While calculating the expected expenditure, ensure that you are not just counting the day to day spending, but also considering your post-retirement goals and plans. For instance, if you want to go on a long vacation once you take a permanent break from work, it is always a good idea to provide for it. Also, let\u2019s not forget that medical costs will constitute a major part of your post-retirement expenses. According to The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Expenditure Survey Report, healthcare expenditure (including insurance) eats up to 15% of one\u2019s post-retirement income.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Understand_taxes_on_retirement_income\"><\/span>5. Understand taxes on retirement income<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most important things that you must know before retiring. While you are calculating your post-retirement income sources and creating that budget for yourself, don&#8217;t forget to take into account the taxes. Up to 85% of your Social Security Benefits are taxable. Withdrawals from retirement accounts such as IRA withdrawals, withdrawals from 401(k) plans, etc. are also taxable. Pensions too are taxable, subject to certain conditions. If the deposits in your pension account were pre-tax, your pension withdrawals will be taxable. If, however, you already paid tax on the money you put in your pension account, you need not pay any tax.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Keep_investing_for_your_retirement\"><\/span>6. Keep investing for your retirement<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In the absence of a regular source of income, the returns on your investments can be your financial support. Thus, it is in your own best interest that you are regular with your investments. To avoid getting distracted, you may automate your investments. For example, with Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), a fixed sum of money or a fixed number of shares gets deducted from your liquid account (bank savings account or a money market account) on a pre-determined date. Thus, SIPs ensure you invest regularly.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"To_sum_it_up\"><\/span>To sum it up<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>For a happy second inning of life, you must prepare for it right from a young age. <a style=\"color: #66696b;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.retirementplanning.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Retirement planning<\/a> is a step by step process to ensure you have enough financial backing when you are not working.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t want to miss out on any retirement essentials?
