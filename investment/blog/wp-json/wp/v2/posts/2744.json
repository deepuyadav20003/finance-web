A fiduciary has a legal and ethical obligation to preserve their clients\u2019 trust. A fiduciary is a financial advisor registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or any state securities regulator, who is legally bound to act with integrity and loyalty towards their client and their clients&#8217; interest and not their employer i.e. a brokerage firm or fund house. Fiduciary financial advisors take care to find suitable products that fit their client\u2019s portfolio after careful analysis to achieve their client\u2019s goals and objectives.

Your financial advisor\u2019s decisions would have an impact on your future lifestyle, hence, it is essential that you hire the right person. Many people assume that a financial professional would act in their client\u2019s best interest; however, that is not the case, always. There are several kinds of advisors, some of whom are incentivized to sell various financial products to their clients, irrespective of the fact that these products serve clients\u2019 best interests or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial\nfiduciaries are legally bound to protect and serve in your best interests. Take\na Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) for instance. He does not sell specific\nproducts to his clients but instead acts in a fiduciary capacity wherein he\noffers financial advice and solutions based on their needs, placing the\nclients\u2019 interests above all else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_Duties_of_a_Fiduciary_Advisor\"><\/span><strong>What are the Duties of a Fiduciary Advisor?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fiduciary advisor is bound to perform both legal and ethical duties within the purview of their role. They must ensure the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Place their clients\u2019 interests above all, even\nbefore their own, while offering financial advice or recommending suitable\nfinancial instruments and products.<\/li><li>Be transparent, act in good faith, and furnish\nall relevant facts to clients.<\/li><li>Be loyal towards their clients at all times. <\/li><li>Be open and transparent about any potential\nconflicts of interest to their clients and avoid any situations that may lead\nto conflicts of interest. <\/li><li>Ensure that they provide accurate,\nwell-researched, and exhaustive financial advice to their clients always.<\/li><li>Avoid that they do not use their client\u2019s\nassets for their own personal benefit; for example, pushing financial products\nwhere they would earn a higher rate of commission when the said product does\nnot fit the client\u2019s risk appetite or financial goals.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Which_Kinds_of_Advisory_Relationships_Constitute_Fiduciary_Duties\"><\/span><strong>Which Kinds of Advisory Relationships Constitute Fiduciary Duties?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Trustee and beneficiary<\/li><li>Executors and legatees<\/li><li>Promoters and stock subscribers<\/li><li>Insurance companies or agents and\npolicyholders<\/li><li>Corporate board members and shareholders<\/li><li>Guardians and wards<\/li><li>Investment corporations and investors<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Do_Fiduciary_Duty_and_Suitability_Standards_Differ_from_Each_Other\"><\/span><strong>How Do Fiduciary Duty and Suitability\nStandards Differ from Each Other?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a financial expert or advisor or any individual who offers investment advice is legally bound to act in the best interest of their client and has a fiduciary duty towards that said client. This entails that a fiduciary must avoid a conflict of interest, cannot earn commission from recommendation and sale of financial products, and must place their clients\u2019 interests before their own personal interests. Since fiduciaries are neutral when it comes to recommending investment products, they are seen as ideal financial advisors. All fiduciary advisors are mandated to fulfill their fiduciary duties when offering their services. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the\nother hand, financial planners and brokers are not governed by a uniform\nstandard of service or mandated by fiduciary duty. They however do follow a\nsuitability standard wherein the advisor must have a reasonable belief that an\ninvestment, transaction, or frequency of transactions fits the needs of the\ncustomer. This suitability standard is set by the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority (FINRA). Here, the term \u2018reasonable belief\u2019 is believed to be\nambiguous and open to interpretation by advisors. Since financial advisors do\nearn commissions from the sale of investment products, there is a distinct\npossibility that they may push investments to meet their sales targets or to\nearn a higher rate of commission where the said investments may not necessarily\nbe suitable for your portfolio. Financial brokers also earn fees from\ntransactions, which may lead to churning of portfolios under the guise of\nsuitability standard of service delivery to earn higher fees. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore,\nit is advised that you procure the services of a fiduciary financial advisor,\nwho performs his fiduciary duties diligently, whom you can trust to make\ninvestments that are first and foremost, most beneficial to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_Benefits_of_Working_With_a_Fiduciary_Financial_Advisor\"><\/span><strong>What are the Benefits of Working With a\nFiduciary Financial Advisor?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can avail several benefits if you choose to work with a fiduciary financial advisor, some of which are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fiduciary financial advisors ensure to invest your finances with the utmost care keeping your investment philosophy, risk appetite, and future goals in mind.
