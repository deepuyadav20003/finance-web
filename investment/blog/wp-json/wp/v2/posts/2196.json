It provides information on how you want to invest your money, where you want to invest it, and how much you wish to invest. It offers your financial advisor an exact vision of your goals, so that they can make crucial financial decisions that align with your requirements. In some ways, an investment policy statement acts as a rule book for your financial advisor, letting them know how they should manage your funds.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_information_does_an_Investment_Policy_Statement_contain\"><\/span><strong>What information does an Investment Policy Statement contain? <\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>An investment policy statement can differ for different investors based on their goals, investment strategies, and risk capacity. The statement can be divided into two parts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your personal objectives and your investment philosophy<\/li>\n<li>The kind of help and guidance you need from your financial or investment advisor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The first part that lays emphasis on your personal objectives and investment philosophy and generally contains the following information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The aim of your investment<\/strong>: The goal of investing is unique to every individual. While some people are looking to grow their wealth, others are just looking for a source of secondary income to meet their routine needs. You could fall into either of these categories. You could also be investing for definite goals such as a child\u2019s higher education, or to buy a house for yourself.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time horizon<\/strong>: This section includes the timeline of your goals and whether you are looking at short-term investment options or long-term investment options. The time horizon largely depends on your investment goals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Asset allocation<\/strong>: This part includes the composition of your investments. For instance, the percentage of stocks, bonds, real estate, mutual funds, cash, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Liquidity and income needs<\/strong>: This section contains information on your income and liquidity needs. For instance, many investors bank on their investments as an emergency fund. In such a case, you need to have highly liquid and easily accessible investment options in your portfolio.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Choice of investment type<\/strong>: This includes your investment type, such as an actively managed portfolio or a passively managed portfolio. In addition to this, the section also includes your investment preferences such as social impact investing, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The second part that talks about the kind of help and guidance you need from your financial or investment advisor generally includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Responsibilities of the financial advisor: <\/strong>This includes the responsibilities that you want your financial advisor to undertake. For example, decisions on where to invest, the execution, keeping track of your investments, and suggesting recommendations to alter your investment strategy if your goals are not being met.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deciding the asset allocation: <\/strong>The involvement of your financial advisor in deciding the asset allocation of your investments, in stocks, bonds, cash, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring the investments: <\/strong>This includes responsibilities like monitoring your investments, reporting the progress and growth of your funds, managing risk, diversifying and rebalancing your portfolio, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_do_you_write_an_Investment_Policy_Statement\"><\/span><strong>How do you write an Investment Policy Statement?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Here are the steps you can follow to write your investment policy statement:<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Start_with_your_investing_goals\"><\/span><strong>1. Start with your investing goals<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>It is important to put down your investing goals along with the time horizon for each. Here\u2019s how you can start:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Write your investment goals:<\/strong> Retirement, a child\u2019s higher education, home purchase, travel, health care, etc. are some examples of different types of goals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mention the time horizon: <\/strong>Retirement can be a long-term However, a home purchase or saving for a child\u2019s education can be short-term goals depending on when you start investing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Set priorities:<\/strong> The urgency of each goal can be different. Your priority also depends on factors like your family\u2019s needs, income, age, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Mention_the_responsibilities_and_duties_of_your_financial_advisor\"><\/span><strong>2. Mention the responsibilities and duties of your financial advisor<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>This section includes the help and guidance you require from your investment advisor. For instance, recommendations, monitoring, risk analysis and management, etc. This section should also specify the amount of flexibility or control you want your financial advisor to have over your portfolio and financial decisions. In addition to this, you can lay down your expectations from your advisor here.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Write_down_your_investing_strategy\"><\/span><strong>3. Write down your investing strategy<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>This portion contains information on your investing strategy. Such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How aggressive you want your investment strategy to be<\/li>\n<li>The kind of investment management style you are looking for \u2013 passive or active investing<\/li>\n<li>Your risk tolerance<\/li>\n<li>The asset allocation you prefer<\/li>\n<li>Your liquidity needs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Include_your_existing_investments\"><\/span><strong>4. Include your existing investments<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Adding your existing investments and savings allows your financial advisor to gauge your future needs. It also allows them to know the current worth of your investments and recommend instruments that can help you gain better returns. You can include information such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your existing retirement accounts like an employer sponsored 401(k) account, an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), a pension plan, a life annuity plan, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Your savings account like a 529 education savings plan, bank accounts, certificate of deposits (CDs)<\/li>\n<li>Your real estate investments like a house, commercial property, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Your cash reserves<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Specify_your_asset_allocation_and_preferences\"><\/span><strong>5. Specify your asset allocation and preferences<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Mention the percentage of asset allocation you want on your portfolio under this head, i.e., the percentage of equity, debt, and balanced funds. For instance, your asset allocation can be<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>70% equity funds<\/li>\n<li>30% debt funds<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also mention your investment preferences, such as whether you want more stocks or more bonds. Additionally, you can write whether you are interested in traditional real estate investments or a real estate investment trust (REIT), etc.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_State_how_and_when_to_monitor_your_portfolio\"><\/span><strong>6. State how and when to monitor your portfolio <\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>This section can contain a wide range of subjects for your financial advisor that may include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The right time to revisit your asset allocation<\/li>\n<li>The threshold to monitor the performance of your investments<\/li>\n<li>The need for annual, monthly, or quarterly reports<\/li>\n<li>The need and level of diversification<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Determine_the_acceptable_costs_and_fees\"><\/span><strong>7. Determine the acceptable costs and fees<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Some investments and savings accounts can come with high costs, such as administration fees, management fees, fiduciary and consulting charges, etc. Moreover, the expense ratio of an investment can have a substantial effect on the returns. You can set a benchmark for these costs and specify what is acceptable and what is not. This gives your financial advisor an idea of which investments would be suitable for your needs.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_Set_a_time_and_threshold_for_rebalancing_your_portfolio\"><\/span><strong>8. Set a time and threshold for rebalancing your portfolio<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Rebalancing refers to bringing your portfolio back to the asset allocation as it was when you started investing. For instance, if you had 60% equity at the beginning which has increased to 70% due to market fluctuations, rebalancing your portfolio will entail ways to bring your asset allocation back to 60% equity.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is it essential to rebalance your portfolio from time to time, but it is also important to determine the right time for rebalancing. Moreover, fixing an acceptable range is also crucial. For instance, an increase or drop of 5% may be okay for you. However, anything beyond this should be a sign indicating the need for portfolio rebalancing.<\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\r\n  .articles-ad-page {\r\n   padding: 25px 5px 10px !important;\r\n   border-top: 1px solid #bebebe;\r\n   border-bottom: 1px solid #bebebe;\r\n   margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n  }\r\n\t.articles-ad-page {padding: 10px 5px; border-top: 1px solid #BEBEBE; border-bottom: 1px solid #BEBEBE; margin-bottom: 20px;\t}\r\n\t.articles-ad-page img {float: left; margin-right: 20px; max-width: 140px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border-radius: 0;}\r\n\t.articles-ad-page .txt {line-height: 21px; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 4px; }\r\n  .articles-ad-page .txt p{font-size: 14px;}\r\n  .articles-ad-page .txt p a{color: #035184 !important; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;}\r\n  .spocored-text{color: #cac5c5; font-weight: 500; float: right; font-size: 12px;}\r\n  .wa-text{color: #183a68; font-weight: bold; float: left; font-size: 12px;}\r\n  .articles-ad-page .alignleft{ float:left!important;}\r\n  .txt-head{margin-bottom: 2px; text-align: left; margin-top: -6px;}\r\n  .txt-text{margin-bottom: 14px;}\r\n  @media screen and (max-width:767px) and (min-width:320px){\r\n      .articles-ad-page .txt-head {margin-top: -15px; float: left; width: 50%;}\r\n      .articles-ad-page .txt {width: 100% !important; margin-top: 12px;}    \r\n      .articles-ad-page { display: block;}\r\n    }\r\n  @media screen and (max-width: 360px) and (min-width: 320px){\r\n    .articles-ad-page .txt-head a {\r\n        font-size: 16px!important;\r\n        line-height: 16px!important;\r\n    }\r\n    .articles-ad-page .txt-head{\r\n        margin-right: 14px;\r\n            width: 45%;\r\n    } \r\n    .articles-ad-page img{ margin:0 10px 10px 0px!important;}\r\n  }\r\n<\/style>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Articles-ad-page\">\r\n\r\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ads_img.jpg\" alt=\"ad_article\" width=\"\" height=\"\" \/>\r\n<div class=\"txt\">\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 2px; text-align: left; margin-top: -6px;\"><a style=\"color: #035184; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/match_advisors.asp?kwd=wa-blog-ad-what-is-an-investment-policy-statement-ips-and-how-do-you-write-one&amp;utm_medium=middle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Need a financial advisor?
