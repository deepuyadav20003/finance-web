					<p>HBW has been a family-owned business since its founding in 1991. The financial world has changed a lot since then. But since our first day we have tried to treat every client as part of the family. That has not changed.  HBW's most basic belief and guiding principle is in providing our advisors and clients the tools they need to stay the course, to stick to their financial plans, to seek control of the factors that form the basis of all other investment success: saving, asset protection through insurance, and tax planning. We also believe our clients relationship with their advisor is among their most important assets when times are challenging.  Quite simply, we believe advice from most independent financial advisors will be better than advice from anywhere else. Our view is that products are products. Real solutions are based on values and goals, not hypothetical investment returns, fear-based sales tactics or big company guarantees crippled by the fine print. Why deal with some firm's inherent conflict of interest if you do not have to?  We are committed to people and families: committed to helping our clients fulfill hopes, accomplish goals, and realize dreams. HBW Advisory Services LLC, is a Registered Investment Advisory Services Company entrusted with over $1 billion in client assets under management.</p>

					<p>I am proud to call myself a Peekskill native, born and raised just 45 minutes north of New York City and a short drive from West Point (USMA). After graduating from Hendrick Hudson High School, I followed my dream of serving my country by becoming a United States Marine. I proudly served from 1999 to 2006, including during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Upon an honorable discharge, I transitioned to a new chapter in Southern California, beginning my financial career at Morgan Stanley. In 2005, I joined Bank of America Investment Services (now Merrill Lynch), and in 2009, I moved to Wells Fargo Advisors, where I had the honor of serving clients for over a decade. Currently, I bring my expertise as a comprehensive Financial Advisor, holding both the Chartered Financial Consultant<sup>&reg;</sup> (ChFC<sup>&reg;</sup>) designation from The American College of Financial Services and the Certified Investment Management Analyst® (CIMA<sup>&reg;</sup>) designation, taught by the Yale School of Management and administered by the Investment Management Consultants Association<sup>&reg;</sup>.  My financial planning services include: <be   	We offer a range of flexible financial services tailored to meet the unique needs of our clients, including comprehensive consulting and asset management. Our approach emphasizes tax-efficient investment strategies and proactive tax planning to help clients minimize tax liabilities and optimize their financial outcomes. Ongoing fees for financial consulting and asset management are based on the size and complexity of the assets under management. Additionally, we provide specialized services, such as Trust and Fiduciary management, and can coordinate with CPAs, Attorneys, Healthcare Professionals, and Long-Term Care providers.</p>

					<p>Matthew V. Pixa is the President and founder of My Portfolio Guide, LLC. Matt Pixa grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and at a very young age learned from a World War II Veteran father who grew up in the Great Depression that money and resources are to be managed prudently. Matt's curiosity and passion for investing was further sparked during the stock market crash of 1987. Being a new investor without any guidance and coupled with the dramatic events of that period, an interest and passion for becoming a student of the markets was born. Matt studied Economics and earned a Bachelor's degree while also competing as a student-athlete for California State University Long Beach. After advancing his career for 12 years he decided to return to graduate school and further his business and finance education by earning an MBA from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. Matt is a proud holder of the CFP® Certification and is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER®. Matt Pixa lives in Seal Beach, CA with his wife Cecilia, daughter Isabel, and son Lance. As a family the Pixas are involved in several Orange County charities, through their church at Saint Joseph, and with several non-profits such as Care for the Poor and Taller San Jose. Matt enjoys coaching youth sports for his children's teams and also competes in Ironman triathlons as a way to stay fit, disciplined, and blow off any left over energy.</p>

					<p>Pasadena Private Wealth provides a variety of standalone financial planning and consulting services to clients for the management of financial resources based upon an analysis of current situation, goals, and objectives. Financial planning services will typically involve preparing a financial plan or rendering a financial consultation for clients based on the client's financial goals and objectives. This planning or consulting may encompass Investment Planning, Retirement Planning, Estate Planning, Charitable Planning, Education Planning, Corporate and Personal Tax Planning, Cost Segregation Study, Corporate Structure, Real Estate Analysis, Mortgage/Debt Analysis, Insurance Analysis, Lines of Credit Evaluation, or Business and Personal Financial Planning. Written financial plans or financial consultations rendered to clients usually include general recommendations for a course of activity or specific actions to be taken by the clients. Implementation of the recommendations will be at the discretion of the client. Our firm provides clients with a summary of their financial situation, and observations for financial planning engagements. Financial consultations are not typically accompanied by a written summary of observations and recommendations, as the process is less formal than the planning service.  We're a different kind of investment advisory firm. That's because we offer much more than investment management: we are a true one-stop shop for personal and business financial advice, delivered seamlessly through one voice.   With over 110 years of combined financial services experience, our bench is deep and our skills range from banking and real estate to portfolio management and corporate retirement plan design.  This enables us to be highly responsive and propose solutions that take into account your entire financial picture, however complex and intermingled your various assets and income streams are.  Because we have witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies of a compartmentalized approach, PPW has purposely tried to eliminate the service layers and the product barriers that are so often present in larger institutions.   Our versatile advisers are trained and equipped to answer a variety of financial questions without always needing to consult a product specialist from another division.  This allows us to be product-agnostic, and makes our professional staff more responsive and more accountable to our clients on all fronts.  Our core belief is that by having all of these skills and services under one roof, we can be better stewards of your family's wealth.</p>

					<p>Pure Financial Advisors, LLC is a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor providing comprehensive retirement planning services and tax-optimized investment management. A pure business model was the vision, and Pure Financial Advisors became the reality.  Doors opened for business in 2007 with no clients, negative revenue, and zero assets under management. Within just fifteen years of the firm's opening, Pure Financial surpassed $4.6 billion in client assets under management (as of March 29, 2023) and is currently helping over 4,100 clients plan for their future.  The foundation of Pure's planning is rooted in decades of time-tested research. Pure Financial looks to financial science as the guiding light to form our strategies, gaining insights and inspiration from the work of Nobel laureates. As the world continues to evolve, Pure continues to learn.  Pure Financial puts education at the core of everything we do. We strive to be a financial resource that people can turn to when they need a helping hand. Pure Financial collaborates with leading academics to provide education on financial strategies that work in the real world. Join us at our next educational event or talk to an advisor today to find out how we can help you reach your financial goals.</p>
