Even though most people are constantly in the pursuit of growing wealth, they may not know how to do it properly.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Process_of_Wealth_Creation_in_4_simple_steps\"><\/span>Process of Wealth Creation in 4 simple steps<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Fixing_goals\"><\/span>1. Fixing goals<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The first step in successful financial planning is setting clear goals. Goals differ individually but can be classified as short-term, mid-term, and long-term. Generally speaking, goals can include paying bills on time, funding a child\u2019s education, securing health, saving for retirement, etc. It is important to prioritize your goals and devise a wealth accumulation strategy around them.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Planning_strategically\"><\/span>2. Planning strategically<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Once you assess your goals and bifurcate your needs and wants, you can develop a strategic plan that keeps a tab on your spending. Wealth growing strategies include making a budget for all your monthly expenses. Sticking to a steady budget decreases the chances of frivolous spending and leads you to accumulate and save your wealth for your future needs. As they say, \u2018save more, spend less.\u2019 You can use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/retirement-calculator\/savings-goal-calculator-how-long-will-it-take-you-8\/\">savings goal calculator<\/a> to determine the growth of your savings.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Evaluating_risks\"><\/span>3. Evaluating risks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Wealth accumulation comes easily only with a steady stream of income. This income can be increased with extra hours of work or getting side jobs. The best way to create an additional source of income is by investing. However, you must consider your risk appetite before choosing your investments so that you don\u2019t end up taking more than you can handle. It is advisable to take the help of a financial advisor to thoroughly study different investments and their risk component in your monthly wealth cycle.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Allocating_assets\"><\/span>4. Allocating assets<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Asset allocation is perhaps one of the most important key factors in multiplying your wealth. But you must structure it carefully. There is a range of areas where you can allocate your money, for example, equities, real estate, bonds, etc. This can be done only when you have a clear idea of the risk and returns involved in each security. You must research well to understand the nuances of asset allocation.<\/p>\n<style type=\"text\/css\">\r\n  .articles-ad-page {\r\n   padding: 25px 5px 10px !important;\r\n   border-top: 1px solid #bebebe;\r\n   border-bottom: 1px solid #bebebe;\r\n   margin-bottom: 15px;\r\n  }\r\n\t.articles-ad-page {padding: 10px 5px; border-top: 1px solid #BEBEBE; border-bottom: 1px solid #BEBEBE; margin-bottom: 20px;\t}\r\n\t.articles-ad-page img {float: left; margin-right: 20px; max-width: 140px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; border-radius: 0;}\r\n\t.articles-ad-page .txt {line-height: 21px; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 4px; }\r\n  .articles-ad-page .txt p{font-size: 14px;}\r\n  .articles-ad-page .txt p a{color: #035184 !important; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;}\r\n  .spocored-text{color: #cac5c5; font-weight: 500; float: right; font-size: 12px;}\r\n  .wa-text{color: #183a68; font-weight: bold; float: left; font-size: 12px;}\r\n  .articles-ad-page .alignleft{ float:left!important;}\r\n  .txt-head{margin-bottom: 2px; text-align: left; margin-top: -6px;}\r\n  .txt-text{margin-bottom: 14px;}\r\n  @media screen and (max-width:767px) and (min-width:320px){\r\n      .articles-ad-page .txt-head {margin-top: -15px; float: left; width: 50%;}\r\n      .articles-ad-page .txt {width: 100% !important; margin-top: 12px;}    \r\n      .articles-ad-page { display: block;}\r\n    }\r\n  @media screen and (max-width: 360px) and (min-width: 320px){\r\n    .articles-ad-page .txt-head a {\r\n        font-size: 16px!important;\r\n        line-height: 16px!important;\r\n    }\r\n    .articles-ad-page .txt-head{\r\n        margin-right: 14px;\r\n            width: 45%;\r\n    } \r\n    .articles-ad-page img{ margin:0 10px 10px 0px!important;}\r\n  }\r\n<\/style>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Articles-ad-page\">\r\n\r\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ads_img.jpg\" alt=\"ad_article\" width=\"\" height=\"\" \/>\r\n<div class=\"txt\">\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 2px; text-align: left; margin-top: -6px;\"><a style=\"color: #035184; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/match_advisors.asp?kwd=wa-blog-ad-wealth-creation-and-wealth-preservation&amp;utm_medium=middle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Need a financial advisor?

This can be challenging as most people tend to get passive about wealth preservation.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Simple_steps_to_Wealth_Preservation\"><\/span>4 Simple steps to Wealth Preservation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Re-evaluating_risks\"><\/span>1. Re-evaluating risks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It is difficult to preserve your wealth with volatile markets and changing trends. That is why it is necessary to re-evaluate the risks associated with every investment you make. With clever marketing gimmicks, investors are sometimes deceived into believing that certain investments are \u2018risk-free\u2019. Keep in mind that while no investment is completely risk-free, nevertheless, with regular re-evaluations and adequate wealth distribution amongst different tools, you can secure good returns on your investments.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Diversifying_investment\"><\/span>2. Diversifying investment<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>As you grow older, your goals might change. Your portfolio and financial standing might also change. This is why you must diversify your portfolio or check the market for better investment options.\u00a0Diversification is crucial for growing wealth.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Getting_insurance\"><\/span>3. Getting insurance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Insurance is a must-have in today\u2019s unprecedented times. It is also a good wealth preservation strategy. Insurance plans work as a monetary cushion during financially difficult times. Insurance policies provide cover against, death, medical injuries, etc. at a monthly premium. Different companies offer different policies. You can find out the one that suits you and your family and use it as a medium to preserve your wealth.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Having_an_emergency_fund\"><\/span>4. Having an emergency fund<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Remember the savings account you put a few dollars into every now and then? You can use this savings account as your emergency fund. Investments can be tricky and insurance policies can expire, but an emergency fund is the surest way of wealth accumulation. An emergency fund will provide you cover during unpredictable times of crises and losses and act as a buffer until you secure additional funds. Generally, it is advisable to have an emergency fund that can cover up to 3 to 6 months of your living expenses.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_major_differences_between_wealth_preservation_and_wealth_creation\"><\/span><strong>What are the major differences between wealth preservation and wealth creation?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Growing wealth is limited to buying more shares, investing in stocks, etc. However, keeping these earnings safe and secure is what wealth preservation is all about. When you put your money in stocks, you earn profits as returns. These profits help you create your corpus of wealth. However, when you put these earnings in a bond as savings for future contingencies, you preserve your wealth.<\/p>\n<p>Wealth creation and preservation can mean different things to different investors. For example, if you buy real estate with an intention of selling it in the future, you increase your chances of creating more wealth. However, if you occupy the premises yourself, your investment acts as a wealth preservation strategy.<\/p>\n<p>In retrospect you will realize that wealth preservation is nothing but a form of wealth creation. It keeps your money safe and secure. Regular interest or a growth in prices allows it to grow over time, acting as an ideal wealth accumulation strategy.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"To_sum_it_up\"><\/span>To sum it up<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Both, wealth creation and wealth preservation, are equally crucial.
