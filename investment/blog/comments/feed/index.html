					<description><![CDATA[Instead of asking financial advisors, &#039;Am I beating what is normal?&#039; a client should ask, &#039;Did I achieve a good risk-adjusted return for my personal situation and goals?&#039; This is a more insightful approach.

To effectively evaluate your financial advisor, always ask questions like:

 - If I lose 10% of my investment in year one and make 10% back in year two, how much have I gained or lost?
 - Can I pay you hourly, and how does that work?
 - If interest rates go up, does the value of a bond fund increase or decrease?
 - Do you have your own money in what you recommend to me? Can you prove that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ll definitely check out the other recommendations you mentioned. Thanks for the fantastic blog article! My wife and I are planning to retire early next year. By then, we hope to have sold our business and city home, and we’ll use the proceeds to pay off the small remaining mortgage on our retirement home in the mountain town we&#039;ve chosen]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would say that to determine your retirement target, it is essential to consider factors like inflation, investment returns, and expected lifespan. A common rule of thumb is the 4% retirement rule, which suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings annually to cover expenses. Assuming this, your target savings would be your annual expenses divided by 0.04.

As for the retirement age, it depends on your current age, financial goals, and how quickly you can save.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If an individual saves half of their annual salary and invests it in a financial instrument that can at least match the rate of inflation for growth, this can provide a viable solution. The money accumulated between the ages of 30 and 58 can potentially sustain them for 28 years post-retirement. It&#039;s essential for everyone to tailor their lifestyle to their current income.]]></description>

		Comment on Can You Open a Roth IRA After You Turn 60? by Jeffrey		</title>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who has benefited dramatically from starting a Roth IRA early, I highly recommend it to others. Investing in dividend-paying stocks within the Roth is wise since any dividends and capital gains earned are tax-free. This means it&#039;s better to pay the taxes now rather than later. Starting early and allowing your investment to grow over time is essential, especially since you&#039;re likely in a lower tax bracket now than in the future.

One of the benefits of a Roth IRA is that you can withdraw contributions tax-free before you reach age 59.5 without facing any penalties. This is not true for traditional IRAs or 401(k)s. Additionally, Roth IRAs are not subject to required minimum withdrawals during retirement.

Another advantage of investing in a Roth IRA is trading stocks and funds within the account without reporting them at tax time. I regret not starting a Roth IRA sooner, as it would have had more time to grow.

It&#039;s important to note that if your employer offers a 401(k) match, you should take advantage of it before shifting funds to the Roth.]]></description>
