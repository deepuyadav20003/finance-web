					<description><![CDATA[Wow, it really helped when you talked about financial planning and how to prepare for your meeting! Recently, my sister said she wants to stop spending so much and start saving! I believe my sister will benefit from consulting with a financial planner, so I&#039;ll suggest it and share your tips with her! Thanks for the insight on organizing your financial paperwork before meeting a financial consultant!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My brother would like to hire a financial advisor that will be able to coach him and his wife with money because they&#039;re newlyweds, and they have no idea how to handle finances. Thank you for this; I&#039;ll make sure to tell them that they must list down their assets and liabilities first. I&#039;m glad that you were also able to clarify here that we must consider our family&#039;s needs and requirements too.]]></description>
