The money you save for your retirement will help support you during your non-working years and allow you to live a life of dignity, comfort, and respect. Having a retirement fund enables you to cover your essential and non-essential expenses, medical costs, as well as ensure and provide financial security for your dependents and loved ones.

To do so, you must hold the account for a minimum of five years and withdraw money after reaching 59.5 years of age. The contributions are not tax-deductible, and all qualified withdrawals are tax-free in nature; also doubling up as an excellent option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement that you are in presently.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Each year Roth IRA contributions &amp; limits are revised by the Internal Revenue Service or the IRS. As of 2022, you can contribute to a Roth IRA if you meet the following income criteria:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Single tax filers earning a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $144,000 or less are eligible to open a Roth IRA.<\/li>\r\n<li>Married taxpayers filing jointly earning a joint MAGI of less than $214,000 are eligible to open a Roth IRA<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As of 2022, the annual contribution limits for a Roth IRA are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Individuals under the age of 50 can contribute up to $6,000 annually. This has remained unchanged compared to 2021.<\/li>\r\n<li>Individuals aged 50 or above can contribute an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000, bringing the total to $7,000 per annum.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_open_a_Roth_IRA\"><\/span><strong>How to open a Roth IRA<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you are thinking of opening a Roth IRA, you can follow the steps listed below:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Check your eligibility<\/strong>: First, you have to find out if you are eligible to invest in a Roth IRA account or not. If you are a single taxfiler, your MAGI should be between $129,000 to $144,000; for married taxpayers, your combined MAGI should be between $204,000 to $214,000. If you lie in these income brackets, you can move ahead to the next step.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Select a place to open your account<\/strong>: You have several options where you can open your Roth IRA account &#8211; bank, credit union, or with an online broker. Each option offers different benefits. If you open your account with a bank or credit union, you can invest in low risk and low return investments like certificates of deposits, money market accounts, etc. On the other hand, online brokers offer high-risk and high-reward investments like stocks, mutual funds, etc. You can choose any option based on your risk appetite and future goals.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Fill out the application form<\/strong>: Next, you have to fill up an application form detailing your name, bank account information, Social Security number, the name and address of your employer, the name, address, and Social Security number of your beneficiaries, etc. Along with this you also need to file an IRS form: 5305-R.<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Pick your investments<\/strong>: Choosing which investments to invest in is extremely important and plays a critical role in meeting your future goals and financial needs. Pick your investments based on your risk tolerance levels and if you have doubts over how to move forward, consult with a financial advisor who can help you with the same. <\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Choose how frequently you wish to contribute<\/strong>: Pick a frequency for your contributions. You can make contributions either monthly or yearly based on your preference.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_the_difference_between_Roth_IRA_and_Traditional_IRA\"><\/span><strong>What is the difference between Roth IRA and Traditional IRA?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let us discuss the differences between a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiseradvisor.com\/blog\/retirement\/things-to-consider-when-deciding-between-roth-or-traditional-retirement-accounts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roth and a traditional IRA<\/a> in detail:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In a Roth IRA, you make contributions from your after-tax dollars, and the subsequent withdrawals are tax-free (dependent on meeting certain conditions explained above). On the other hand, in a traditional IRA, contributions are made from your pre-tax dollars, and your withdrawals are taxed in retirement.<\/li>\r\n<li>If you have chosen a traditional IRA, your contributions are tax-deferred whereas in a Roth IRA your contributions grow tax-free. If you wish to save taxes in the present, you can opt for a traditional IRA, however, if you believe you would be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you should go for a Roth IRA as it would be more beneficial for you in the long run.<\/li>\r\n<li>Moreover, if you have invested in a traditional IRA, you do not have to adhere to any income limits. However, for a Roth IRA, your MAGI should be less than $144,000 or less as a single taxpayer and $214,000 as a married and joint taxpayer, to qualify for contributing to a Roth IRA.<\/li>\r\n<li>Further, if you own a traditional IRA, you must take mandatory Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) after the age of 72, failing to do so would result in hefty penalties and taxes. However, there are no mandatory RMDs for a Roth IRA.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_should_you_keep_in_mind_before_opening_a_Roth_IRA\"><\/span><strong>What should you keep in mind before opening a Roth IRA?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing between opening a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA account is an important decision that should not be taken lightly and without going over the ros and cons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let us discuss certain points that will offer you better clarity with respect to the efficacy of Roth IRA:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You have the option of converting your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, though, you would have to pay taxes on your previous contributions and earnings. You can lower your taxes by opting for partial conversions.<\/li>\r\n<li>You have the option to open up an IRA for your child as long as the child is earning income from a part-time job, be it from offering tuition, babysitting, waiting tables, etc. This kind of an IRA is known as a custodial IRA account which can help your child cover higher education costs or set up their own business at a later stage in life. By investing in a Roth IRA account, your savings grow over time rather than lying idly in a bank.<\/li>\r\n<li>You can also open a spousal IRA who has the same contribution limits &#8211; $6,000 if you are below 50 years of age (or $7,000 for people aged 50 or older). You can open a spousal IRA even if your spouse does not earn any income. You can contribute on his\/her behalf\u00a0 provided you have an earned income.<\/li>\r\n<li>There is no set age limit for opening a Roth IRA account. Children can have a custodial Roth IRA. In addition, if you should choose to, you can keep contributing to your Roth account for as long as you want provided you do so from an earned income.<\/li>\r\n<li>You can also pass on your Roth IRA to your beneficiaries. Any withdrawals made by them will also be tax-free, provided the 5-year holding period for the account was completed.<\/li>\r\n<li>You are not allowed to take out a loan from your Roth IRA but you do have the option to withdraw funds for a 60-day period, known as a tax-free rollover. Herein, you must deposit the money back within the stipulated time. You can do one such tax-free rollover once a year.<\/li>\r\n<li>The following kinds of incomes cannot be contributed to a Roth IRA:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Rental income<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Interest income, capital gains, and stock dividends<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pension<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Annuity income<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>Finally, you cannot contribute more than you earn in a financial year in a Roth IRA account.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let us go through some FAQs that will shed some light on lesser known facts about a Roth IRA.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Frequently_Asked_Questions\"><\/span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_What_is_a_spousal_Roth_IRA\"><\/span><strong>1.

It is a separate account which you can open and provide for your spouse\u2019s financial security.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Can_you_suffer_a_monetary_loss_in_a_Roth_IRA\"><\/span><strong>2.

If you have a low risk tolerance, you can choose low risk investments for your portfolio.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_What_are_some_of_the_downsides_of_a_Roth_IRA\"><\/span><strong>3. What are some of the downsides of a Roth IRA?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking to invest in a Roth IRA, you need to consider low annual contribution limits and delayed tax benefits before you decide on opening a Roth IRA account. Moreover, you cannot avail a loan facility from your Roth IRA, which is not the case if you invest in a traditional 401(k) account, which does offer a loan facility to its investors. Further, if you make an early withdrawal before reaching 59.5 years of age or completing a five year holding period, you would have to pay a 10% penalty in most cases.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Is_a_Roth_IRA_suitable_for_people_with_less_income\"><\/span><strong>4.

Your financial needs and goals are a better determinant of which retirement plan would be the right one for you. While a Roth IRA offers better investment options and can be used by people who do not have an employer plan like the 401(k), as well as people who already have a 401(k) and want to invest more money to create a substantial retirement corpus. Alternatively, a 401(k) enables you to save more money for retirement since its annual contributions are higher than a Roth IRA. Further, you need to take out mandatory RMDs in a 401(k) while there is no such rule for a Roth IRA. Be sure to take into account all the benefits and drawbacks of both these retirement accounts before making a decision.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_How_much_money_should_I_contribute_monthly_to_my_Roth_IRA\"><\/span><strong>6.
